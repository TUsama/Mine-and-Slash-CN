3.15.9:
- Increased Healing variance has been reduced, floor has been increased and ceiling decreased. Before it was 5-20 now the base value is 10-15.

3.15.8:
- Increased Team Map difficulty.

3.15.7:
- Added a new Game Changer talent: Clever Escapist - can be found in the bottom right of the tree. On a successful dodge, receive a 5s buff that gives 10% increased damage and 20% damage reduction.
- Steady Hand has been moved to the very bottom of the tree.
- Steady Hand stats have been streamlined. Nothing has changed functionally.
- Reduced Magical Life health penalty from -15% to -10%.
- Side Step now grants 30% multi to dodge and 30% spell dodge, rather than 25% of each.
- The left side of the talent tree that has the Phys Gained stats now has nodes that actually are useful leading up to it.
- Hopefully fixed Reckless Blows and Berserker's Impartiality elemental portion of their stats.
- Sources of the flat core stats have been lowered (eg. instead of getting 9 Vitality, you may receive 6 instead on an item).
- Reduced Critical Damage stat values by about 25%.
- Increased floor of health stat values.
- Increased health percent stat values.
- Increased the flat stat values of magic shield substantially, but reduced the percent stat values. This should make magic shield a little stronger at lower to mid levels, and less powerful on the upper end.
- Reduced Arctic Armor regen penalty by 25%.
- Reduced Critical Surge, Power Surge, and Lightning Spear's bolt synergy damage by about 25-33%.
- Venom Load max level is now set to 12 rather than 4. It took too few points for it to become very effective. The spell should require a bit more investment.
- Venom Load radius per level has been reduced so that by max level it should have a radius of 4 instead of 5.
- Venom Load duration now scales from 3s to 5s instead of 5s to 7s.
- Venom Load mana cost has increased by about 10%.
- Venom Load cast time has increased by 50%.
- Venom Load damage remains unchanged.

- Reduced the health and magic shield penalty of Flesh and Mind Sacrifice by about 25%.
- Increased damage of Omnislash Finisher and Anti-Gravity Finisher slightly.
- Increased the cooldown of Force's Finishers by 1s and Extensions by about 0.5s.
- Unique Runes now respect the rune drop before x level config.
- Fixed missing localization for plus force spell level stat.
- Prevent the game from crashing on null effect data, temporary solution.

3.15.6:
- Reworked Venom Load since the self-damage was not working properly. Instead of working like Righteous Flame from POE, it now works like Blade Vortex. It now has no cooldown and a very short cast time. You can have up to 10 stacks of Venom Load, and for each stack, you will deal Nature DoT Damage to nearby enemies, which scales with your health. At level 1, each stack will deal 4% of your max health every half second (max 40%), and at max level, each stack will deal 8% of your max health every half second (max 80%).
- Fixed Raging Dragon Extension not expending a starter stack and generating an extension stack.
- The following spells have had their tick rate readjusted to prevent them from malfunctioning when over-leveled: Ice Orb, Steam Cloud, Arrow Storm, Thorn Bush, Holy Flower, Thunderstorm, Nature's Balm,
- Soul Shred description has been updated.
- Rime Blade cooldown is now 4s instead of scaling from 7s to 4s.
- Tidal Wave cooldown is now 3s instead of scaling from 4s to 2s.
- Lowered thorn value from Nature's Armor and Blazing Shell.
- Lowered the first level cooldown of Fire Bombs, Blazing Inferno, Arrow Barrage, Dash,
- Meteoric Strike cooldown is now 3s instead of scaling from 7s to 4s.
- Inferno Quake cooldown is now 4s instead of scaling from 7s to 5s.
- Provoke cooldown now scales from 14s to 11s instead of 16s to 9s.
- Purifying Flames cooldown is now a flat 2s instead of scaling from 2s to 1s.
- Healing Wave cooldown is now 2s instead of scaling from 2s to 1s.
- Martyrdom cooldown is now a flat 3s instead of scaling from 4s to 2.5s.
- Charge cooldown now scales from 9s to 7s instead of 13s to 6s.
- Whirlwind cooldown now scales from 8s to 6s instead of 10s to 6s.
- Lowered Whirlwind duration, which increases hits per second.
- Retribution cooldown now scales from 5s to 4s instead of 6s to 4s.
- Spirit Ball cooldown is now a flat 3s instead of scaling from 3s to 2s.
- Poison Cloud cooldown is now 4s instead of scaling from 6s to 3s.
- Double Shot cooldown is now a flat 3s instead of scaling from 4s to 2s.
- Lowered the first level cooldown of Arrow Barrage, Dash.
- Charged Sweep cooldown is now a flat 3s instead of scaling from 4s to 2s.
- Animate Scythe cooldown is now a flat 3s instead of scaling from 4s to 2s.
- Chilling Touch cooldown is now a flat 3s instead of scaling from 4s to 2s.
- You can no longer dodge "bolt" damage, DoTs, and reflected damage.
- Changed Mob Speedy particle to be less intrusive.
- Summons should no longer attack fish and most passive water mobs.
- Orb of Transmutation and Orb of Alchemy will now try to roll for prefix/suffix/secondary/chaos stats when used.
- You can no longer use a Chaos Orb, Chaotic Wisp, Crystal of Legend, Unearth Prefix/Suffix on common rarity equipment.
- True unarmed attacks (not gauntlets) are now classified as Basic Attacks rather than their own type.
- Team EXP and loot reward multiplier has been reduced.
- Fixed a bug where the infusion stat was doubling damage unintentionally.
- Fixed an issue where spells recovering Magic Shield, Mana, and Energy were not functioning at all.
- Fixed an issue where Arcane Devotion was giving 10 times the amount of flat magic shield as intended. This fix should prevent players from getting a boatload of MS with no investment.
- Fixed a registry error.

3.15.5b:
- Fixed localization.

3.15.5:
- Reduced the attack scaling of almost every Force attack spell. They should be closer to what you'd expect from attack spells of other trees.
- Increased the energy cost of almost every Force attack spell. Currently, you don't even need to invest into Energy. I want players to have to invest a bit into Energy to upkeep the quick combos.
- Increased the base damage of Burn, Blight, and Cripple significantly.
- Increased the duration of Burn and Cripple.
- Reduced the the radius of Poison Cloud by about 20% at max level.
- Reduced the base value of Soul Shred effect slightly since it scales with magic shield anyway.
- Ice Blade now provides Frost Infusion.
- Power Surge now provides more Lightning Attack Damage.
- Added more particle and sounds effects to Flowing River Extension.
- Increased Enlighten Faster Cast Rate and Energy Regen buff.
- Empower now grants increased damage instead of physical attack damage. Flat physical attack damage was too strong in the early game. Increased damage should scale better. This will make it more useful in party play as well.
- Fixed missing Gauntlets assets.
- Improved Flame Blade tooltip to specify spell damage.
- Soul Shred now accurately says "DoT" instead of spell damage.
- Fixed Blessing and Angelic Raiment to not be an "aura" buff.
- Minimum Health is now 10 instead of 1.
- Changed Conjurer spell damage penalty to be a flat -50% instead of -80% multi. This could be worse in some cases.
- Conjurer now provides 15% increased duration instead of 10% cooldown reduction.
- Ruthless now gives 25% increased DoT damage instead of 30%.
- Ruthless now also gives 10% increased duration.
- Whirlwind now lasts a static 7 seconds (still affected by duration modifiers) instead of scaling from 7s -> 13s.
- Whirlwind tick rate no longer increases. It now will always strike 20 times within 7 seconds (once every 7 ticks), instead of scaling from 20 times within 7 seconds to 80 times within 13 seconds (once every 3.25 ticks).
- Whirlwind attack scaling per level has increased so that by max level each hit does 25% more damage than previously. I recognize this is a nerf to overall DPS but these changes should 1. make whirlwind feel a bit better to play instead of it lasting an entire 13s, and 2. ease up on server load when the skill is active. Currently, the particles and the rate at which calculations are done with so many hits is putting too much load on the server.
- Whirlwind cooldown has been lowered to compensate for the reduced duration.
- Whirlwind mana cost and energy cost have been lowered slightly as well.
- Bone Squall now always has a 3s cooldown instead of scaling from 6s to 3s.
- You can now learn a third Mastery tree at level 100 instead of 120.
- Orb of Transmutation and Stone of Hope now retain the item stats when upgrading rarity!
- Orb of Transmutation always upgrades from common to uncommon, whereas Stone of Hope retains its functionality and will roll one rarity or more higher.
- Added a new currency orb, Orb of Chances, that can reroll secondary stats.
- Added a new currency orb, Orb of Alchemy, that turns common rarity items into rare.
- Using an Orb of Transmutation, Orb of Alchemy, and Stone of Hope will now retain the item identification status. They will also take into account if an item is runed, and will add a rune slot if appropriate.
- Lowered the rarity of Key Of New Dawn.

3.15.4:
- You now lose a static % exp on death rather than dynamic based on your current exp.

3.15.2:
- Increased bow and crossbow base damage.

3.15.1:
- Lowered mob difficulty at lower levels slightly.

3.15.0:
- NEW MASTERY TREE: Force - utilize the unique brawler-type spells in this tree to deal tremendous damage or support your allies. The force tree has 4 main types of spells: Strikes, Extensions, Finishers, and Buffs. Strikes, Extensions, and Finishers are all attack spells. Use a Strike to gain a Combo Starter effect, which is required and expended upon use by Extension attack spells. Similarly, Extension attack spells will gain you a Combo Extension effect, which is required and expended by Finishers. Use the different types of Strikes, Extensions, and Finishers to "build your own combo" and create your own truly unique playstyle! For example, for an elemental combo, you might start with Elemental Strike (all elements) -> Raging Dragon Extension (fire/lightning) -> Elemental Vengeance Finisher (all elements, big AOE)! Look below for more combo examples... The possibilities are endless! Buffs are straight forward, there are two types of buffs: Empower and Wisdom. Empower grants an increase in damage, whereas Wisdom grants increased regeneration and cast speed. There are ways to provide these to yourself and your allies! Two unique things about the Force tree is that (almost) all spells only cost energy, and are not affected by cooldown reduction. However, these short cooldown attack spells can still be used in rapid succession. Be sure to mix them up!
- Support your allies with Goading Strike (AOE taunt) -> Flowing River Extension (frost, heal allies) -> Earthen Smash Finisher (AOE nature, increase ally defenses).
- Go for big physical damage with Piercing Strike (lowers def) -> Rallying Sweep Extension (AOE, increase ally speed and damage) -> Sweeping Strike (AOE) -> Triple Attack Extension (3x hits) -> Omnislash Finisher (high physical burst).
- Apply Spell Blade + Flame Blade and take advantage of the on-attack effects, and use Piercing Strike -> Triple Attack Extension -> Omnislash Finisher.
- NEW WEAPON TYPE: Gauntlets - once implemented in an indev version, this item type was quickly scrapped as it was logistically difficult to show how a player might "wield" a gauntlet in Minecraft... However, with the new Force tree, it just made sense to implement it to the best of my ability. These quick-acting weapons can really leave a mark on your opponents. They attack as fast as daggers and do more damage at the expense of more energy!
- Summon targeting AI now prioritizes mobs that hurt them > nearest mob > mobs that hurt the caster > mobs hurt by the caster, INSTEAD of mobs that hurt the caster > mobs hurt by the caster > mobs that hurt them > nearest mob. This should alleviate summons ganging up on a sole enemy (not prevent outright though). This will also give more functionality to Chilling Touch synergy.
- New Divine Spell: Blessing - bless yourself and your allies and increase your spell damage and mana on hit.
- New Divine Spell: Seethe - apply Enrage stacks on self. Higher levels apply more Enrage stacks.
- New Divine Spell: Angelic Raiments - increase the armor and dodge rating of yourself and nearby allies with this new buff.
- Changed Enrage to give affected targets percent increased damage taken and increased damage dealt, rather than lowering their armor and increasing their physical damage.
- Enrage movement speed buff has been lowered from 10% to 8%.
- Changed Piercing Winds so that instead of lowering damage and cooldown, it does the opposite. It now increaes damage at the expense of increasing cooldown.
- Nature's Armor no longer provides armor and instead provides a new stat: increased healing received.
- Lowered particle counts for some AOE spells.
- Lowered Increased Healing and Armor Penetration values on the talent tree.
- Lowered the radius of some of the basic melee attack spells.
- Replaced some talent nodes with Gauntlets weapon damage.
- Improved tooltips for some confusing stats such as weapon damage and attack damage.

3.14.11:
- Added a Reset All command which resets stats, spells, and talents at once. Useful for testing builds.
- Add Remove Talent Potion now gives you 3 removal points rather than 1.
- Added a new craftable Reset All potion that uses 1 of each reset potion.
- Renamed Lucky to Prosperous, and Luck to Lucky. The core stat Luck remains unchanged.
- Reduced sources of lifesteal and spellsteal stats.
- Reduced potency of critical damage stats substantially. Critical hit remains untouched.
- Increased physical damage of weapons when they only roll physical damage so they're more in line with multi-element weapons.
- Reduced the attack scaling of attack spells to compensate for the increase in physical damage of weapons.
- Since Elemental Attack Damage is already taken into account when using attack spells and summons in their scaling, it will no longer be added "additionally" to the attack when damage is dealt. No more double dipping for free.
- Due to changes to Ele Atk DMG, reworked Physical Dispersion a bit to implement a failsafe in case the player uses a physical spell. It will check the player's ele atk dmg stat instead.
- Physical Damage gained as X element now works similarly to Physical Dispersion. You gain the elemental damage at the end of the calculation now - it will also work on spells.
- Weapon Damage and Elemental Weapon Damage now properly apply after the fact.
- As a result of the above changes, Spell Blade no longer provides "Physical Damage Gained as Fire Damage" since it would no longer synergize with the Spell Blade synergy. Instead, it now provides "Physical Damage Converted to Fire Attack Damage" similar to how Poisoned Weapons works. This will result in a substantial reduction in Spell Blade damage, but was how the spell was originally meant to function.
- Due to the Spell Blade "nerf", Flame Blade has been buffed a bit to compensate.
- New Ocean Spell: Purity - provides yourself and nearby allies elemental resistances.
- New Ocean Spell: Arctic Armor - provides yourself with damage reduction at the expense of mana and energy regeneration.
- New Ocean Synergy (Arctic Armor): Rejuvenating Armor - while Arctic Armor is active, (all) hits have a chance of applying Cold Essence on self.
- New Ocean Attack Spell: Rime Blade - hits in an AOE in front of the user similar to Inferno Quake. Damage is converted to Frost. Using the spell also fires  frost projectiles in front of the caster, each dealing half the damage as spell damage.
- Ice Blade no longer provides Frost Attack Damage but rather Physical Damage Gained as Frost Damage.
- Ocean buffs have double in duration and the cooldown for them is now 10 seconds, more inline with other buff spells. I still want them to be shorter duration because my goal is for players to "manage" the Ocean buffs rather than setting it and leaving it. This is in part due to the sheer quantity of buffs Ocean has. These changes do not affect Frost Shield.
- Reduced the cast time to Frost Shield to be in line with the other Ocean buffs.
- Increased the cooldown of Frost Shield slightly.
- New Fire Summon Spell: Summon Archon - summon an archon that attacks enemies. Periodically, the summon will also recover nearby allies' mana. The base value of the mana recovered is the same as the summon's damage.
- New Fire Synergy (Summon Archon): Incendiary Touch - gives ALL summons a chance to deal AOE fire spell damage on attack.
- New Fire Spell: Blazing Shell - converts a portion of your armor into magic shield and also provides fire thorns.
- Chain Lightning no longer targets armor stands.
- Raised the floor but lowered the ceiling for Charged Sweep mana scaling.
- Lightning Totem now has a base tick rate of 20 instead of going from 40 -> 20.
- Lightning Totem radius now scales up to 4 by max level instead of 3.
- Lightning Totem can no longer fire multiple totems and is capped at 1.
- Lightning Totem base damage has doubled.
- Lightning Totem static synergy chance has been reduced at max level.
- Static Field cooldown has increased by 1 second.
- Static Field now deals 18% instead of 20% of remaining enemy health.
- Lowered Voltaic Blast chance and base damage slightly.
- Increased Stray Current base value slightly.
- Lightning Spear bolt synergy damage floor has increased but ceiling has decreased.
- Lowered the cost of Quick Charge slightly.
- Increased the mana cost of Recharge.
- Recharge duration is now a flat 60 seconds.
- Increased Lightning Dash cooldown by 20%.
- Lowered the critical hit chance from Critical Surge from 5% to 4%, but increased spell damage from 7% to 8% base.
- Increased lightning attack damage of Power Surge by about 30%.
- Lowered mana cost increase of Battery Fusilade's synergy slightly.
- Lowered Battery Fusilade's synergy's max level from 12 to 8.
- Increased Battery Fusilade's synergy's radius at lower levels.
- Battery Fusilade's synergy chance to trigger has been reduced, but now scales depending on how many Lightning Essence the caster currently has. At max stacks, the chance is higher than what it was before.
- Synergies of Battery Fusilade, Critical Surge, and Power Surge, as well as the Divine Judgment effect are now properly classified as "Bolt" damage types, similar to how Lightning Spear bolt synergy is classified. This means that these will not be modified by spell damage (elemental still works though). To make it more clear, these synergy and effect tooltips have been updated, and a lightning bolt sound and visual will be played when these trigger. Additionally, the synergies will no longer trigger themselves (eg. Voltaic Blast used to be able to trigger itself as long as the damage was a critical hit. Now, this is no longer possible).
- Voltaic Blast and Overload now deal their extra AOE damage to the target struck as well, instead of only nearby enemies.
- Static Discharge synergy has returned (synergy of Charged Sweep), which gives a chance to apply Static effect on hit.
- Charged Sweep no longer applies Static 100% of the time.
- Lowered the attack scaling of Plague from 16% to 15% at max level.
- Changed Venom Load to give increased DoT damage as well as spell damage.
- Defend now gives 35% instead of 50% damage reduction at max level, and puts a 15% move speed debuff on the caster.
- Increased Unholy Meditation heal values.
- Increased Summon HP slightly.
- Summon Zombie and Summon Skeletal Army no longer scale with weapon damage.
- Summon Zombie and Summon Skeletal Army base damage values have been increased tremendously to compensate for their lack of brains.
- Summon Hunting Wolf no longer has a base value and only scales with weapon damage. The rate at which it scales has been increased.
- Summons now move 33% faster.
- Tried to make summons more aggressive, they should now target everything but players, other summons/tamed, passive golems, and ageable entities. Please let me know if I've missed anything on the blacklist.
- Summons taunting on hit should be more consistent now, and can only occur every 3 seconds.
- Charge, Healing Aura, Inferno Quake, Gorgon's Gaze, Arctic Blast, and Soul Shred are now properly tagged as Area spells and display their "radius" which is actually the distance in front of the caster. Increased Area stats should now properly affect these spells.
- Mob base damage has increased slightly.
- Lowered mob armor slightly.
- Increased mob health in team dungeons.
- Fixed an issue where team dungeons were giving a 3x multiplier on exp instead of 2x.
- Reduced the armor penalty of Avatar.
- Vampire gives a smaller multi on lifesteal now. The rest of it remains unchanged.
- Reduced Warlock DoT steal and DoT damage.
- Warlock penalty has been reduced from -25% to -20% health and magic shield.
- Added some sources of armor pen to the tree.
- Mana should no longer take damage when player has Mana Battery and a teammate hits them.
- Fixed a bug where if you were on a team or in a party, you couldn't hit yourself. Which also should fix Venom Load not being able to kill the user.
- AOE spells now specifically look for enemies only.
- Fixed some instances of "Water" and "Thunder" to "Frost" and "Lightning".
- Implemented a fix where if you die multiple times at once somehow, you will only lose EXP once.

3.14.10:
- Nature's Avatar has been reworked and renamed to just Avatar. Instead of converting everything into nature damage, it now gives Physical Dispersion, dodge, and some penalties to health and armor.
- Increased the spell damage penalty on Pacifist.
- Cleaned up some tooltip stuff for Berserker's Impartiality and Reckless Blows.
- Reduced the defensive penalty of Reckless Blows.
- Fixed a bug regarding EXP share and the level penalty.
- Fixed a bug where Purifying Flames judgment synergy required the mob to already have at least one stack of judgment before applying judgment. This is no longer the case.
- Fixed a bug where Bleed was actually doing 8% of your phys instead of 10% like it says in the tooltip.
- Lowered innate mob resistances.
- Increased damage reduction from Defend from 25% to 50%.
- Significantly increased Defend's cooldown.
- Block now costs energy ONLY when actively blocking (regardless of fail or success). Currently, blocking is too strong and a bit braindead. By incorporating energy cost, players will have to actively balance their energy and think about when they should actually block.
- Thorns no longer drains energy.
- Fixed an issue where effects such as burn and plague were capped at over-level 13 instead of 16.
- Sources of block chance have been reduced.
- Vitality now provides about 33% less energy regen than it did previously.
- Lowered elemental attack damage map mob affix to about 18% of what it was before.
- Enrage now gives half as much physical damage as it did previously.
- Removed the map affix that adds mob elemental attack damage and physical dispersion.
- Replaced the above map affix with one that gives "gain xx% of physical damage as 'insert element'al damage".
- Added a new all elemental penetration map affix for mobs.
- Added a new health regen map affix for mobs.
- Fixed some mislabelled health and magic shield costs in the spell tooltips showing double what they should have.
- Mobs should no longer randomly one shot players when using Enrage effect since it has been nerfed, and most mob sources of physical dispersion stat have been removed. Enrage was effectively doubling and sometimes tripling mob damage at max stats, and all of that physical damage was being converted to an element...

3.14.8:
- Changed how weapon damage stat and elemental weapon damage stat work. Before, they would check if the damage effect had the same weapon type as the stat. However, most damage sources such as spells don't have an explicit weapon type. So these weapon damage stats would only apply to basic attacks. I've changed it so that it applies as long as the damage effect is of the attack type (basic attacks, attack spells, summon attacks), AND if the player is holding a weapon of the same type. Eg. if you're holding a bow, anytime you perform an attack, you will get your bow weapon damage bonus applied.
- Lowered Talent weapon damage node values from 8% to 6%. Elemental weapon damage remains the same. I kept increasing it slowly over time thinking that it wasn't good enough, turns out it just never worked as intended. It would be way overtuned (probably) if I didn't reduce it again.
- Reduced some mob stats slightly.
- Increased base mob damage.
- Reduced Rock Slide damage.
- Hopefully fixed an issue where spell-casting mobs were doing ridiculous amounts of damage.
- Increased intensity of map affixes.
- Mobs no longer have built-in armor and elemental penetration.
- Swords no longer require luck and instead require vitality.
- Hammers no longer require vitality and instead require more strength.
- Attack scaling of all attack spells has decreased due to the weapon damage stat.
- Physical damage talent nodes have been reduced in effectiveness.
- Fixed a bug where Bone Squall cost 60% health at level 1 instead of 6%.
- Spell Blade no longer converts 100% phys to fire damage but 60% instead.
- Bleed duration has increased from 5 to 7s.
- Defend gives less 25% less armor than previously.
- Resourceful trait now gives a -multi rather than a +multi.
- Familiar Instincts now gives a -25 multi to HP regen rather than 40.

3.14.7:
- Fixed a bug where Martyrdom was costing 80% health instead of 8%.
- Increased mob armor and resist stats.
- Reduced mob HP and damage ceiling in regards to mob rarity. In general, higher rarity mobs will deal less damage.
- Increased base mob damage. Even lower rarity mobs should pack a punch.
- Plague duration has been reduced significantly.
- Plague attack scaling per level has been reduced slightly.
- Plague base value per level has been increased slightly.
- Burn duration and base value has increased.

3.14.6:
- Team Dungeons now also provide players with a large bonus to Unique Item drops.
- Changed mob scaling so mobs are much stronger at lower levels, but slightly easier at higher levels.
- Weak mobs have had their power increased by 9%.
- Fixed an issue where some mob stats were not scaling with their level properly (reists, elemental penetration, armor penetration).
- Fixed an issue where non-map worlds had tiers but the tier stat bonuses weren't applying to mobs.
- Mob stats that were not scaling properly have been increased by a bit.
- Mob stat rarity scaling has been reduced from uncommon to champion rarity substantially.
- EXP has been shifted from higher rarity mobs to lower rarity mobs.
- Increased attack scaling of Hunting spells substantially.
- Enrage now applies a taunt to enemies every tick. This means Martyrdom and Whirlwind have the potential of taunting enemies as well.
- Increased the mana and energy cost of Retribution.
- Retribution attack scaling has been reduced.
- Martyrdom now costs health to use. Its mana and energy costs have been reduced.
- Martyrdom health scaling has been reduced.
- Provoke is now an instant cast spell.
- Provoke cooldown has increased.
- Provoke AOE has increased.
- Bravery, Trickery, and Wizardry core stat bonuses have been reduced by 25%.
- Improved Wounds effect attack scaling to bring it more in line with other DoTs.
- Increased Burn effect base damage per level.
- Reduced Plague effect attack scaling.
- Improved health bar by showing magic shield values in brackets.
- Improved Gorgon's Gaze description.
- Fixed Retribution not actually being shorter lasting.
- Fixed an issue where Venom Load was dealing Nature damage to self but Physical to nearby enemies.
- Fixed Malevolent Offering synergy missing localization.

3.14.5b:
- Fixed Venom Load description.
- Made Axes and Daggers use Luck stat instead.

3.14.5:
- Venom Load now deals 40% max health to self as Nature DoT damage, instead of 10%. It now deals 10% to mobs instead of 20% of max health.
- Reduced the base value and scaling of some of the summon spells.

3.14.4:
Core Stat Changes:
- Core stats have been reworked a bit. Some stats have been shifted around. The main issue was "magic casters" were able to easily funnel their point into Intelligence and get defense, damage, and sustain consistently, whereas melee and especially ranged were forced to spread over at least 2-3 different stats. Hopefully, the changes below will make it more necessary for spell casters to invest in Wisdom, while still retaining some of their high burst potential. The idea was that spell caster stats would be Int/Wis, melee would be Vit/Str, and ranged would be Dex/Vit. Additionally, a 3rd "flex" stat that any build could use has replaced Stamina.
- The changes to energy on dexterity, strength and vitality should make it easier to upkeep energy.
- Vitality now provides health, health regen, and energy regen instead of health and armor. The health regen it provides is 33% less than what it used to provide when it was on Strength.
- Strength now provides phys damage percent, armor, and flat energy instead of phys damage percent and crit damage. The flat energy it provides is 33% less than what it used to provide when it was on stamina (it is now available on two diff stats now).
- Intelligence still provides the same ele spell dmg, magic shield percent, and mana, but now provides 33% less mana.
- Wisdom still provides the same increased healing, magic shield regen, and mana regen, but now provides 33% more magic shield regen, and 50% more increased healing.
- Dexterity now provides phys damage percent, dodge, energy, and bow/crossbow damage, instead of dodge, crit hit, and armor pen. The energy it provides is equivablent to what Strength provides per point. The idea for this stat was to be beneficial mainly for ranged damage dealers, but stay as just an option for them. If they want to run dodge, they get rewarded with more damage specific to bows/xbows. However, they can still run strength instead if they want to opt for armor.
- Stamina has been renamed "Luck" and now provides some armor pen (less than what it used to provide on Dex) and critical hit and damage. The crit damage it provides is 50% more than what it used to provide on Strength.

Talent Changes:
- New Talent: Nature's Avatar - half of non-nature damage is converted into nature damage. Deal no non-nature damage. Also increases all nature damage and nature resistances a bit.
- New Talent: Shulker Shell - 60% of damage received is converted into physical damage. Also lowers armor and elemental resists.
- New Talent: Conjurer - increases summon damage substantially but deal substantially less spell damage.
- New Talent: Trickster - critical hits have a 25% chances of giving self a power charge (max of 3) for 6s. Each power charge gives 30% flat critical damage. Hopefully this talent makes critical builds a little more engaging and rewarding.
- New Talent: Overseer - attacks have a 50% chance of giving self a fortitude charge (max of 3) for 8s. Each fortitude charge gives 4% damage reduction. Hopefully this talent makes attack/tanky builds more engaging to play.
- New Talent: Pocket Capacitor - increases magic shield regen substantially, but makes it so you cannot life or spell steal.
- New Talent: Resourceful - use energy instead of mana when casting spells with a mana cost. Spells with mana and energy costs will just combine the two.
- The talent tree has been expanded! An additional "ring" that's generally easier to traverse across has been added. Most of the new talents listed above can be found in this ring.
- Harmony now reduces effectiveness of heals by 33% instead of 50%.
- Reduced the amount of flat life and spellsteal from Vampire by 33%.

Spell Changes:
- New Nature Spell: Venom Load - applies an effect on caster that deals nature damage to self based on a percentage of their maximum health every half second. It also deals AOE nature damage equal to double the damage dealt to self every half second to nearby enemies. The effect/buff? also provides the caster with substantial flat spell damage.
- New Hunting (Summon Hunting Wolf) Synergy: Sharpened Fangs - causes summons to have a chance of applying Wounds.
- Fixed an issue where certain spells could be cancelled and not trigger the cooldown.
- Fixed magic shield cost not appearing on spells.
- Fixed an issue where some synergies weren't triggering such as Electrical Discharge's.
- Health and magic shield costs now display the percent and the actual value next to it in brackets.
- Improved spell tooltip hint about holding shift.

3.14.3:

- Nourishment now provides less health regen, but also gives mana and energy regen now.
- Frost and Corrosion slow is now 10% instead of 5%.
- Cripple slow is now 7% instead of 5%.
- Quick Charge resource cost penalty has increased. The CDR it gives is too strong for the penalty it has.
- Increased Lava Quake base scaling.
- Lowered mob damage by rarity a bit. So higher rarity mobs don't do _that_ much damage.
- Lowered mob damage overall just a bit.
- Mob speed is now 20% instead of 100%. No one likes teleporting mobs.

3.14.1:
- fix infinite loop with lightning discharge affix.

3.14.0:
- Added a new tier 3 currency called Orb of Companionship that turns maps into "team dungeons". These dungegons are substantially more difficult and rewarding.
- Duration of the really really long buffs have been lowered. This includes the Divine buffs.
- Cast time for buffs has also been lowered.
- Mana Cost Reduction stat now affects all resource costs and has been renamed to Spell Cost Reduction.

- Mobs should have about 25% more health now.
- Increased mob damage at higher levels.
- Added a new mob affix in maps giving Spell Dodge.
- Slows from spells and effects have been readjusted. They have all been toned down. Some effects such as Whirlpool and wounds no longer slow enemies.

3.13.16:
- Lowered the health cost of Summon Skeletal Army and Hellfire Cloak.

3.13.15:
- Fixed an issue where after playing for a long time, players were lagging when hit... FINALLY!
- EXP level penalty is now determined on an individual basis when in a party, instead of based on the killer. This means a level 50 partying with a level 20 will no longer grant the full experience to the level 20 when killing a level 50 mob. Instead, if the level 50 wishes to power level the level 20, they can kill level 20 mobs. This should prevent excessive power leveling (still possible, just a lot slower).
- Party EXP boost is now capped at 6 players. Eg. party of 2, you get 120% of the exp divided by 2, so each player gets 60%. At a party of 6, you will get 200% exp, divided by 6. At a party of 7, you will still only get 200% exp.
- Party share only applies to members within 100 blocks of the killer and within the same dimension.
- The following changes were made to bring the runes more up to date with newer and a larger variety of stats. No more two runes providing the same stats!

- Rah rune now gives elemental attack damage percent instead of elemental penetration percent on the armor slot.
- Dos rune now gives armor penetration instead of elemental penetration on the armor slot.
- Readjusted some resource (HP, Magic Shield, Mana, etc.) values across the board. There should overall be a 10-20% lower ceiling.
- Reduced effectiveness of elemental penetration and elemental spell damage flat stats by about 33%.
- Shifted some stats around in the Stat Info window.
- Fixed missing unique item textures.
- Fixed Atronach Chaos stats giving elemental spell damage percent instead of flat.

3.13.14:
- Stone of Corruption now adds 250 instability instead of 500, and adds an addition 10% break chance instead of 20%.
- Chaotic Wisp no longer adds instability, but has a flat 20% chance to break the item instead of 25%. It also no longer halves the total break chance (this is overall a nerf).
- Chaos Orb now grants -50 instability instead of 25.
- Increased critical hit and critical damage flat and percent stats. Critical should be a little bit easier to invest into now with more payoff.
- Increased physical damage flat stat by about 10%.
- Chaos and Major Arcana Chaos stats have had their weightings readjusted. In general, when using a Chaos orb, there is approximately a 15-20% chance of getting a bad stat, and a 5-10% chance of rolling a Major Arcana Chaos stat.

- The Fool arcana chaos stat gives more dexterity now, and also gives physical attack damage percent instead of lightning spell damage.
- The World arcana chaos stat now gives frost and nature attack damage percent instead of nature resist.
- The Lovers arcana chaos stat now gives armor and elemental penetration instead of health and magic shield regen. ;)

- Wheel of Fortune arcana chaos stat now gives armor penetration instead of fire penetration.
- The Magician arcana chaos stat now gives magic shield percent and more lightning spell damage but no longer gives mana.
- Tower arcana chaos stat now gives a bit of health on top of damage reduction.
- Fixed damage reduction stat working inversely... So instead of reducing damage by 5% it was reducing it by 95%. Oops.
- Fixed block not working as intended.
- Fixed a problem where stats that gave bonuses to all elements (eg. all elemental spell damage) would actually make elemental resist apply to that stat. So if you had 1% all elemental spell damage and 25% all elemental resist, you would end up with 25% all elemental spell damage and 25% all elemental resist... Oops.
- Purifying Flames now scales from 180% to 320% instead of 100% to 150%.
- Purifying Flames cooldown has been decreased.
- Greatly buffed the following healing spells: Heart of Ice, Healing Wave, Wish, Healing Flower. Some of the max levels for these spells have been reduced, increasing the rate at which they scale. I may rework these spells in the future.

- Frost Blade buff now gives 25% more flat frost attack damage.

- Fixed Life Siphon being triggerable off of allies and summons.

3.13.13:
- Fixed heal power/increased healing only affecting incoming heals and taking the stat of the receiver instead of the caster. It should now work as intended.
- Buffed some Chaos stats. Barbarian and Clumsy Scholar have less of a penalty now.
- Negative Chaos stat effects are much less punishing now.
- Earth, Fire, Frost, and Thunder Atronach chaos stats now additionally grant Increased Duration, Projectile Speed, Cooldown Reduction, and Area of Effect, respectively.
- Lord of Blizzards, Earthquakes, Thunderstorms, and Volcanoes have been removed and reworked into new chaos stats.
- Lord of Blizzards is now "Holy" and provides bonuses to Increased Healing and Faster Cast Speed.
- Lord of Earthquakes is now "Bulwark" and provides bonuses to Block Chance and Thorns.
- Lord of Thunderstorms is now "Resourceful" and provides bonuses to Cooldown Reduction and Increased Duration.
- Lord of Volcanoes is now "Seething" and provides bonuses to Phys to Fire conversion and Fire Weapon Damage. It can also now only roll on weapons.

- Quick Learner has been renamed to Studious.
- The Death Major Arcana stat no longer has a penalty to health. It now instead provides a bonus to DoT damage.
- Chilling Field scales from 6% to 12% max mana and 3 to 6 base value insead of 4% to 12% max mana and 2 to 6 base value.

3.13.12d:
- Mobs can now cast some basic spells. Most of them are "on hit", whether they're hit or they cause the hit.
- Cold, Flaming, Lightning, and Venomous mob affixes have been changed to be spell oriented.
- Frost Nova Spell - When mob deals damage, send out a nova of ice from the target that deals damage around them in AOE. The spell also applies a 33% slow for 3s.
- Flame Sweep Spell - When mob deals damage, spew forth flames in front of them to damage in AOE.
- Lightning Discharge Spell - When mob deals damage, send out a lightning nova that deals damage around them in large AOE.
- Weaken Curse Spell - When mob receives damage, weaken the attacker with a curse that reduces spell damage, cooldown reduction, and elemental resistances for about 10 seconds. The curse also applies a small Nature DoT on the attacker.
- Bleed Spell - When mob deals damage, apply 2 bleed stacks to targets in front of them.
- Uncommon and rare mobs have a higher chance of having affixes.
- Fixed an issue where some conversion traits such as Magical Life and Fortified Reaction were not taking into account bonuses from core stats, finally!
- Removed Dodge Ignore stat. It was causing issues with log spam and was not working as intended.
- Buff: Arcane Devotion now gives a flat 100 magic shield on top of the 50% multi.
- Buff: Berserker's Impartiality now reduces elemental attack damage by 20% instead of 25%.

- Buff: Pacifist now gives 25% cooldown reduction instead of 20%.
- Nerf: Power Overwhelming now gives 20% spell damage instead of 25%.
- Change: Refreshing Breeze now recovers 2% of your max health on a successful dodge instead of 10% of your max energy. On the other hand, failing to dodge consumes 2% of your max energy.

- Nerf: Steady Hand now increases damage by 15% instead of 20%.
- Buff: True Hit now multis critical hit chance by 35% instead of 30%.
- Fixed some Yon rune bugs.

3.13.10:
- Fixed Summoned Zombies and Skeletons having hurtboxes of Spiders. Unholy map delvers, rejoice!
- Lightning Spear Galvanic Arc synergy no longer infinitely loops and deals crazy burst damage.
- Slightly buffed Spell Blade synergy. Radius increase by 1, and scaling at max level has been increased.
- FINALLY fixed Power Surge, Critical Surge, and Spell Blade synergies being active even when the buff wasn't active. No more free triggers!

3.13.9:
- Buffed Divine aura buffs substantially. My goal was to make the buffs more relevant and sought out in parties. Eg. change from ele spell dmg to cdr should make it more useful in groups:
- Bravery now gives substantial amounts of Vitality, Strength, Health Regen, and Block Chance instead of small amounts of Health, Block Chance, and Strength.
- Trickery now gives substantial amounts of Dexterity, Stamina, Energy Regen, and Critical Hit Chance instead of small amounts of Critical Hit Chance, Energy Regen, and Dexterity.
- Wizardry now gives substantial amounts of Intelligence, Wisdom, Mana Regen, and Cooldown Reduction instead of small amounts of Elemental Spell Damage, Mana Regen, and Intelligence.
- Buffed Poison Ball by increasing its base value damage by max level by 20%, and attack scaling values by about 10% across the board.
- Buffed Rock Slide by increasing its base value damage by 50% and doubling the attack scaling values.
- Reduced the cooldown of Gorgon's Gaze substantially. At max level it is now 12 seconds instead of 18 seconds.

- Reduced the mana cost of Thorny Armor by about 40%.
- Reduced the mana cost of the Nature Curses by about 20%.
- The max level of the Nature Curses has been increased from 4 to 6. They have been greatly buffed, but it will require just a few more points of investment to make the most out of them.
- Corrosion now reduces armor and dodge rating at a base rate of 500, up from 150, and reduces movement speed by 15%, up from 10%.
- Quietus (Mortality Sap Curse) now reduces flat physical damage and a very very substantial amount of health regen instead of critical hit chance and damage. Crit values were non-scaling and were not very impactful.
- Mind Rot now reduces magic shield at a base rate of 100, up from 25, mana regen by 50, up from 5, and elemental resists by 33%, up from 15%.

3.13.8:
- Charged Sweep AOE has been reduced.
- Charged Sweep now always applies Static.
- Charged Sweep's synergy, Static Discharge has been removed.

3.13.7:
- Reduced mob dodge rating by about 33%.
- You now get an "out of resources" warning when you are out of mana/energy.

3.13.6:
- Increased Chilling Field mana damage scaling by about 50%.
- Increased Whirlpool damage by about 7% and reduced its mana cost slightly.
- Increased Frost Totem damage by about 10%.
- Increased Burn damage by about 17%.
- Reduced damage of Critical Surge Splash and Power Surge Bolt by about 40-50%.
- Reduced the chance of Power Surge Bolt from 10-30% to 5-20%.
- Increased Multi/Wide Shot damage by about 14%.
- Fixed an issue where traps weren't lasting their entire duration.
- Traps now require at least 1 second of "preparation" before activating. Basically, they need to be one the ground for at least a second before they explode. This should make it easier to hit more than one enemy now instead of the trap exploding immediately upon contact. This will be a small nerf to Cluster Traps, but I think it's a bit needed given how powerful Cluster Traps was in cramped settings.
- Traps can no longer explode in the air.
- Trap durations have all been changed to a flat 10s.
- Snare Trap now deals damage on top of snaring enemies.
- Snare Trap AOE now goes from 1.5 -> 3.5 instead of 1 -> 3.
- Enfeeble Trap has been renamed to Rancid Trap, and the effect of Weaken has been renamed to Nauseous.
- Rancid Trap AOE now goes from 2 -> 4 instead of 1 -> 3.
- Rancid Trap now deals significant nature DoT to enemies caught in its blast for 10s.
- Reduced Armor reduction and Elemental Resist reduction from Rancid Trap by 25%.
- Reduced Plague damage by 20%.
- Reduced Bleed damage by 20%, and duration from 6s to 5s.
- Hopefully fixed a rare NPE for summoned creatures.

3.13.5:
- Mobs now have built in health regen (a low amount).
- Reduced block chance nodes on the tree and from Stout Defender.
- You can no longer use Chorus Fruit or Ender Pearls in maps.
- Lowered chance to apply Static from Charged Nova from 90% -> 80%.
- Hopefully fixed Fireball not doing damage sometimes.
- Hopefully fixed the Storm Attack Spell synery not applying Static.

3.13.4:
- Lightning Spear Lightning Strike synergy damage has been reduced by about 40-50%. The previous damage values were unintended and were designed around the synergy requiring 8 points instead of the current 4. For the amount of points required, the synergy was far too strong.
- Lightning Spear damage has been reduced by about 9%.
- Lightning Totem chance to apply Static has been reduced.
- Fixed some synergies having a maximum level of 12 instead of 1.

3.13.3:
- Blocking has been reworked. You can now PASSIVELY BLOCK without holding up your shield (needs to be in offhand still). Upon a successful passive block, reduce damage by 25%. You can also still ACTIVELY (hold up the shield) block. When actively blocking, your block chance is DOUBLED (capped at 75).
- If you're actively blocking and you successfully block, reduce damage by 100%, otherwise if you fail, you still get to reduce it by 50% (same as before).
- Decreased effectiveness of Block Chance stats substantially (by about 60%). Since you can double your block chance by actively blocking, this shouldn't really affect players who were used to the previous style of blocking.
- Shield can now also roll elemental resist as a secondary stat.
- Thorns stat has been buffed by about 25%.
- Thorns stat now reflects additional damage if holding up a shield. Upon a successful block, reflect 50% more damage back, and upon an unsuccessful block, still reflect 10% more damage back. The tooltip has been updated to reflect this.
- Orbs and Torches can also roll elemental resist as a secondary stat, but at half effectiveness of what shields can roll.
- Improved tooltip for blocking and thorns.
- Nature Armor now provides a substantial amount of Nature Thorns (the reflect damage kind).
- Increased Defend's Physical Thorns by 100%.
- Changed Heal Power tooltip for now until I manage to fix increased healing...

3.13.2:
- The goal of the following changes is to make each "ball" spell feel unique to play. Nature is unchanged because I just changed it. I also aimed to improve the feeling of Storm early-game.
- Shortened the duration that the ball spells stay active.
- New Ocean Spell: Frost Totem - fires piercing glacial blasts at the nearest enemy that deal frost damage.
- New Storm Spell: Chain Lightning - fire a crackling streak of lightning that has a chance to bounce from the initial target to the next closest target (can bounce between two targets!).
- New Chain Lightning Synergy: Conductor - hits have a chance to apply Lightning Essence on the caster.
- Ice Bolt no longer pierces and has reverted to its original 'bolt' form. It has received a buff to damage to keep it in line with the other new ball spells, however.
- Fireballs now explode upon contact and deal AOE damage.
- Lightning Spear has been reworked and now fires a piercing projectile. It functions similarly to Ice Bolt but goes further. The below changes were made to keep it in line with the power of the other projectiles. It's still stronger than before.
- Lightning Spear now has a longer cooldown and deals about 9% less damage.
- Lightning Spear no longer gives the caster a movement speed boost upon hitting the enemy.
- Electric Prowess chance to apply Lightning Essence on self has been reduced greatly since the projectile now pierces.
- Lightning Totem can now be learnt at level 5 instead of 10.
- Battery Fusilade can now be learnt at level 40 instead of 50.
- Spear of Judgment has been renamed to Trident of Judgment.
- Added the "Pierce" tag to Ice Orb, Spirit Blast, and Lightning Spear.
- Reduced the cast time of Blizzard, Volcano, Thunderstorm by about 40%.
- Reduced the cast time of Whirlpool, Ice Orb, Gorgon's Gaze, Steam Cloud by 50-70%.
- Reduced the cast time of totem spells by 50%.
- Fixed a bug where the dodge map affix was actually giving mobs armor.
- Fixed Dodge Ignore not working which should also fix dodge log spam bug!

3.13.1:
- Hammers deal 16% more damage than previously. They're down 12.5% from patch 3.12.15 instead of 25%.
- Increased the AOE radius of hammers by 50% from 1 -> 1.5.
- Enemies hit in hammer AOE take 50% of the damage the target takes.
- Properly removed the double damage from Hammers.
- Reduced the energy cost of swords by about 9%.
- Turned off dev tools (oops).

3.13.0:
- Mobs now have innate Dodge Rating (less then armor amount) - should fix some of the log spam error and also give dodge ignore a little more use.
- The hammer no longer deals double damage to single targets.
- Reduced the radius of the hammer's AOE very slightly.
- Reduced energy cost of daggers by about 20%.
- Lowered the attack speed of hammers.
- Lowered the damage rolls of axes by about 17%.
- Lowered the damage rolls of hammers by about 25%.
- Fixed many effects affecting movement speed. They were multiplying the total movement + modifies rather than the base alone.
- Reworked Lightning Dash to give a large boost to movement speed for a short duration instead of "dashing" you.
- Energy Dash synergy no longer exists.
- Many spells have been changed to scale with all weapon damage rather than just physical damage. Only Charge still scales with physical attack damage.
- As a result of the above change, attack scaling has been reduced slightly (except for summons and some effects) by about 10%.
- Improved tooltips where damage conversion is concerned.
- Improved tooltips for when movement speed or attack speed is modified.
- The Yon rune has been updated and can give + spells to ANY spell, synergy, or effect, not just some of them.

3.12.15:
- Nature's Armor has a lower mana cost and cast time at max level.
- Nature's Armor now has a static 60 second cooldown instead of going from 70 -> 60 seconds.
- Thorny Bush no longer knocks back enemies.
- Defend now casts instantly.
- Defend now lasts 5 seconds instead of 6.

3.12.14:
- Spell Changes:
- Increased "gain" per level for a spell. This means each point in a spell will provide more damage, scaling, mana cost, etc. than before. This applies to ALL spells and synergies! In general, spells with lower max levels will scale at a greater rate. This may throw balance out the window a bit so things will probably change in the future. You will notice a lot of the cooldowns will be lower as a result, too.
- Reduced the mana cost of many spells (mostly spells and not attack spells).
- Increased the base damage of most non-attack spell spells. About 20% increases at higher levels. This should help spell casters at higher levels and make investing points in a skill more rewarding.
- Buffed literally every (except maybe one) Synergy. All "chance to x" synergies have had their chances increased, etc. Storm probably sees the biggest buff from this.
- Increased mana scaling of Chilling Field by 25% at higher levels.
- Magic Burst mana cost no longer increases as it levels. Instead, the magic shield cost increases, but damage has been increased to compensate.
- Slightly reduced mana cost of Blizzard.
- Fixed a bug where Battery Fusilade projectiles were sometimes affected by gravity.
- Increased health scaling of Martyrdom and some Unholy spells.
- Increased armor scaling of Retribution.
- Increased physical attack scaling of Purifying Fires at higher levels.
- Increased physical attack scaling of Whirlwind at higher levels slightly.
- Spear of Judgment can be learnt at level 20 instead of 40.
- Increased damage of Spear of Judgment.
- New Synergy (Spear of Judgment) - Enlightenment: successful hits restore mana to the user and nearby allies.
- Thorny Bush radius no longer scales with level.
- Increased Thorny Bush damage by about 40%.
- Rock Slide has changed to a classic "storm" spell this is mostly so that it can function still in lower-ceiling areas.
- Reduced damage of Rock Slide and the synergy since having it as a proper storm spell increases the consistency.
- Reduced Rock Slide tick rate.
- Rock Slide now gains radius as it levels.
- Increased magic shield scaling of Soul Shred.
- Lowered the height and variability at which stones and arrows spawn for Rock Slide and Arrow Storm. This should help Arrow Storm but probably still won't help with 2 block-high ceilings.
- New Level 10 Hunting Spell - Arrow Totem: summon a totem that fires an arrow at the nearest enemy!
- Fixed Recoil of the Hunter having a max level of 8. Should be 1.
- Fixed some incorrect Nature Mastery localization.
- Fixed a bug where synergies had incorrect max levels. You will notice a bunch of them have changed - these were the intended values.
- Fixed a bug where a lot of the spell sounds weren't playing properly.
- Improved the sounds of some of the spells to make them feel more responsive.

3.12.13:
Nature Mastery Rework:
- Poison Ball and Thorn Bush have swapped places (Thorn Bush is the new level 1 spell).
- Thorn Armor and Rock Slide have swapped places.
- Poison Ball now fire 3 projectiles and is much stronger.
- Poison Ball has been renamed to Spirit Blast.
- Plague Balls no longer procs Thorns and instead deals additional damage if the target is affected by it.
- Thorn Bush no longer deals additional damage if the target is affected by it, and instead procs Thorns.
- Thorn Bush now only fires 1 seed across all levels.
- Thorn Bush no longer has a cast time.
- Thorn Bush can be bound to a mage weapon.
- Thorn Bush has been reworked to be more bursty - it lasts only 2 seconds but hits multiple times, and has a smaller radius.
- Poison Cloud has a lower cooldown and lower mana cost.
- Rock Slide has been buffed and is now more appropriate as an "ultimate".
- Rock Slide synergy Stone Shrapnel is now Virulent Shrapnel and causes Rock Slide to deal much more damage if the target is affected by at least 6 stacks of Thorns.
Other Spells:
- Ice Bolt now travels faster and pierces enemies, but deals slightly less damage. It also costs slightly less mana.
Renamed:
- Thorns has been renamed to Plague. A bunch of Nature spells have been renamed to reflect this change.
- Hunter Instinct has been renamed to Hunter's Instinct.
- Chilled has been renamed to Chill.
Fixed:

3.12.12:
- Buffed Spell Damage, Elemental Spell Damage, and Elemental Penetration stats.
- Buffed Armor Penetration stat.
- Fixed Magic Burst and Rock Slide not able to be right-click casted when holding off hands. Had to remove their cast times. Increased their cooldowns to compensate.
- Bone Squall is no longer right-click castable (never worked to begin with).
- Charged Nova synergy not applying Static effect should be fixed.

3.12.11:
- Fixed missing wand name.

3.12.10c:
- Fixed server crash.

3.12.10b:
- Some effects like Burn, Wounds, Thorns, now have a minimum base value of 1.
- Animate Scythe now has an unscaling base value of 1, and it's description more accurately explains how it works.
- Defend now also provides a 15% damage reduction to all sources.
- Chilling Touch scaling has been reduced a smidge.

3.12.10:
- At maximum level, you can now unlock a 3rd mastery tree.
- Fixed experience curve not working past level 100. I've changed it to continue the regular curve, just 10x more experience for now.
- Fixed NPE for Dodge Ignore (hopefully).
- Fixed Identify Tome using all stacks.

3.12.9:
- "Rare" mobs (which were actually uncommon) have been renamed to "Adept" to prevent confusion.
- Experience required to level up past 100 scales significantly faster than 1-100 (max level is 100 by default, this is for people who may want to increase it).
- There is a new EXP multiplier config in the dimension config.
- Fixed a bug where instead of giving a 20% bonus chance for map drops while in a map, it was actually a -80% chance... Map sustain should be much more bearable after this fix!
- Chaotic Wisp now has an additional 25% chance to break your item instead of 20%.
- Reduced the power of Chaos and Major Arcana stats. In general, there are less positive "multis". These stats were meant to be risky to apply, but currently they're too strong and low-risk. The change above also reflects this.
- Some Spell Changes:
- Almost all cooldowns have been reduced greatly, this is an aRPG not an MMORPG! Notably, storm spells have been reduced the most. Buffs remained almost unchanged.
- All spells now have a minimum of 1 second cast time except Attack Spells, "basic/ball" spells, Nature's curses, movement spells, and the Hunting Potion.
- Summon Zombie and Summon Wolf cooldowns no longer change with level. Zombie cooldown is now 30 (buff), and wolf's cooldown is 45 (nerf).
- Duration for the following spells is now unchanging per level and has been set to what it would be "maxed": Holy Flower, Magma Flower, Steam Cloud, Volcano, Arrow Storm, Thorn Bush, Blizzard, Chilling Field, Whirlpool, Thunderstorm, Blight, Hellfire Cloak, Soul Shred.
- Given that the above changes will probably drain your mana and energy at even quicker rates, reduced the rate at which mana and energy cost (not health) increases per level. In some cases before, the mana/energy cost would double by max level. Now, they'll only cost 50% more than the level 1 cost.
- Some spells have had their initial costs reduced as well.
- Lightning spells have relatively higher mana costs than other masteries, but lower cooldowns.
- Fire spells have relatively higher damage than other masteries, but have higher cooldowns.
- Reduced scaling of Purifying Fires slightly.
- Fixed runes giving twice the stats they were supposed to give.
- New stat: Damage Reduction which reduces damage by a percent. At the moment, only one Major Arcana trait uses it.
- Cooldown reduction stat has been lowered in power slightly.
- Improved shield tooltips when holding shift.

3.12.8:
- 2 new weapon types: Daggers, and Wands.
- Daggers are fast attacking critical-based melee weapons.
- Wands are like staves, but specialize more in healing and utility stats. Also, wands can only roll physical damage as a primary stat. They are also faster attacking.
- Staves no long roll increase healing as a secondary stat and can now roll faster cast rate instead.

3.12.7:
- Armors only require one core stat to equip now. The idea is that armor can be "more easily" equipped, with weapons being the build-specific equipment.
- Staves now have spell damage as a primary stat.
- Fixed a bug where staves only required intelligence to equip.

3.12.6:
- Jewelry primary & secondary stats have been reworked. Rings are now more focused on resists, necklaces on flat resource stats, bracelet on resource regeneration. Charms remain the same, focusing on core stats.
- ALL jewelry secondary stats are now the same. They can roll elemental resists only as secondary stats, and the amount they give is half of what it used to be.
- Ring primary and secondary stats are half as effective as other jewelry.
- Shield secondary stats are now the same as Torches and Orbs (core stats).
- Mixed some missing textures (oops).
- Fixed leather4 armor knee caps being too low.

3.12.5:
- FINALLY FIXED a long-standing bug where dimensions with tiers were given a tier of 0 instead of the tier they were set to.
- Loot crate scores are now hidden since they don't do anything.
- Renamed and retextured the old Identification Tome to Identification Scroll.
- Added a new item: Identification Tome - identifies your entire inventory at once. The recipe for making this consists of scrolls, an ore, and leather.
- Reworked primary stats of armors. Plate and leather no longer give HP as a primary stat, this has been moved to the secondary stats. All armors now give 1.5x rate of their main stat (plate = armor, etc.), or 1x rate of their main stat and 0.75x rate of another defensive stat (plate = 1x armor + 0.75x magic shield, etc.). This should improve diversity by allowing players to spec into two defensive options and not feel forced to go into just one.
- Secondary stat of armors has also been reworked. You can no longer get raw "core stats" from secondary stats (vit, dex, etc.). Secondary stats now are more specific to the armor type, and all armors can roll HP (plate rolls the highest, cloth and leather tied). Added some more useful stats to secondary stat pools for armors, but also added 2 junk stats to offset it.
- Armors have been re-textured to look 100x nicer.

3.12.4:
- Changed stat scaling to be more linear from level 1-50, spiking from that point on and capping at level 70. Before, it spiked at level 30/40 and capped out too early.
- Weapon damage scaling has been toned down. Previously, weapon scaling would be almost 50% more than that of spells and other stats. Now, it should be roughly the same.
- In general, you will feel weaker, but scaling should be more balanced between the play styles. Keep in mind that mobs will also scale slower too.
- Decreased Mine and Slash sword attack speed to be more in line with vanilla swords.
- Decreased Mine and Slash axe and staff attack speed to be more in line with vanilla axes.
- Decreased Mine and Slash hammer attack speed.
- Increased damage rolls of axes and hammers to offset the decrease in attack speed. The same change has been applied to uniques.
- Increased hammer energy consumption by 10%.
- Staves now can roll pure elemental attack damage rather than physical + elemental.
- Stat requirements for weapon types have been changed slightly. In general, stat requirements have been increased. The general trend for stat requirements is that each weapon type has a "main" stat, and a "secondary" stat. Secondary stat requirements are almost negligible. You may require a respec!
- Removed annoying ping from Recharge skill.

3.12.3:
* Updated Chinese localization. Thank you gulugulu!
* Changed sound of reflect/thorns stat.
* Reflect/thorns now applies passively and doesn't require you to hold up your shield. It will not apply if you dodge the hit.
* A "failed" block now reduces damage by 50% instead of 25%.'
* Fixed shield [Shift] information.
* Increased scaling value of Double Shot.

3.12.0:
Talent Tree Rehaul:
* Basically the entire tree has been remade. The pathing choices should be a lot more interesting, and lots of paths branch to improve pathing. For instance, the mage (top) section no longer contains 4 huge node wheels, 1 for each element, and instead has one small section for all elements. The rest of the space is used for other new stats that have been slowly introduced over the past few updates.
* General ideas for the tree now: nodes and clusters closer to the start point are more "general/all-encompassing" than previously. Like mentioned above, more "spell damage" vs. "fire spell damage/water spell damage". As you go further from the center, the clusters become more specific. I think the bottom quadrant was most culprit to this, having only specific weapon damage nodes at the start.
* Left side has been rebranded to be more summon/support heavy. It still retains a lot of block chance, elemental resists, etc. In fact, it no longer gives infusion stats but straight up elemental attack damage percent increases.
* The starting regions have been heavily changed.
* The tree now has Increased Area of Effect, Increased Duration, and Increased Projectile Speed nodes.
* Spell Power and Elemental Spell-related nodes have been reduced in power a bit.
* Bleed Mastery now gives a -15% damage multi to physical damage and -25% damage multi to elemental.
* Bleed has been changed to have max 20 stacks instead of 8, but deals 10% of your physical attack damage per stack instead of 25%.
* Blood Mage and Overflowing Vitality have swapped positions.
* Fortified Reaction now gives a -10% armor multi instead of -20%.
* Fortified Reaction, Reckless Blows, and Steady Hand have moved.
* Ruthless and Warlock have been toned down in power.
* Physical damage and DoT nodes have been reduced in effectiveness a bit.
* Weapon damage nodes (non-elemental) have been buffed.
New Spells/Synergies:
* New Level 5 Storm Spell: Electrical Discharge - deal 20% of nearby enemies' CURRENT effective health (includes magic shield) as lightning damage. Points into this spell reduce its cooldown, mana cost, and increase its range. This spells damage can be modified by increases to spell damage, etc.
* New Electrical Discharge Synergy: Static Field - hits have a chance to apply Lightning Essence stacks on the user. Remember, this thing hits multiple enemies!
* New Level 10 Storm Spell: Recharge - Recover 1% of your maximum mana per second. Points into this ability increase its duration. This ability has a 2 minute cooldown that is unaffected by cooldown reduction.
* New Level 1 Hunting Attack Spell: Double Shot - fire 2 powerful arrows in rapid succession. This replaces Arrow Barrage as the starter spell, Arrow Barrage is now a higher level spell.
* New Arrow Storm Synergy: Serrated Storm - gives Arrow Storm hits a chance to apply Wounds.
* New Chilling Touch Synergy: Necromancer's Hex - causes nearby summons to attack the target. This gives you finer control of your summons.
Summon Changes/Fixes:
* Summons deal a little less damage than before.
* Summons now go poof when they disappear.
* Summons now disappear if you die or change dimensions (this is to prevent crashes).
* Summons have about 25% less HP (they had too much with the recent addition of bonus HP per level).
* Summons move a little slower now.
* Fixed an issue where Summon Attacks weren't actually being registered as attacks.

* The synergies of the above spells have been buffed.
* Reduced the energy cost of most attack spells.
* Reduced the cooldown of every spell EXCEPT: Whirlwind, Heavy Strike, Basic Spells, Arrow Barrage, Arrow Storm, Craft Arrow, Dash, Exert/Imbue, Hunting Potion, Summons, Poisoned Weapons.
* Some spells like Fire Bombs, Lightning Totem, and a few others' radius now scales with ability level.
* Life Siphon can no longer be set to right-click.
* Life Siphon cooldown has been increased (didn't realize the cooldown was shorter than the duration).
* Animate Scythe now does the two hits at the same time instead of a channel. Channelling messes with right click binding code.
* Chilling Touch costs slightly more energy now.
* Poison Balls has been renamed to Poison Ball again.
* Poison Ball only fires 1 projectile again.
* Poison Ball has been reworked. It is now a slow (but faster than before) moving orb that pulses every x ticks to deal damage to nearby enemies (like a slower version of Ice Orb). Increasing its level will increase its tick rate, radius, and duration.
* Poison Ball now travels 50% faster.
* Poison Ball can travel through enemies and disappears upon block impact.

* Lightning Dash can be learned 10 levels earlier now.
* Critical and Power Surge can be learned at level 30 instead of 5 now.

* Increased cost of Craft Arrows.
* Arrow Barrage is now a level 30 spell.
* Arrow Barrage fires 1-2 less arrows by max level than previously.
* Arrow Barrage cooldown has increased.
* Arrow Barrage wounds synergy now belongs to Double Shot, and the chance of applying has increased.
* Wounds effect now stacks up to 5.
* Wounds effect slow has been reduced from 25% to 10%. Also, it now says this on the tooltip. How many of you knew Wounds actually slowed?
* Wounds effect deals less damage per stack. The same applies for its health regen debuff.
Stat Changes:
* New Stat: Dodge Ignore - it's basically armor pen but for dodge.
* New Stat: Increased Duration.
* New Stat: Increased Area of Effect.
* New Stat: Increased Projectile Speed.

3.10.3:
Stat Changes:
* Stat changes below are to encourage users to pour into other stats instead of just a single stat. Also, some changes, such as moving mana/magic shield regen to wisdom were made to make putting stats into wisdom feel less "bad" when not going for magic shield. You'll notice I basically shifted things around.
* Vit (before): health, health regen --> (after) health, armor
* Strength (before): physical damage, armor --> (after) physical damage, critical damage

* Wisdom (before): magic shield, magic shield regen --> (after) heal power, magic shield regen, mana regen

* Fixed missing localization for spell costs.
* Spells that modify attack scaling now display how much they'll modify it by if you hold shift.
* Cleaned up the Stat Info GUI.

* Bleed Mastery now gives -25% to all elemental damage instead of -20%.
* Fortified Reaction now gives a -20% multi to armor instead of -25% multi to dodge. I believe the multiplier was applying after the conversion, therefore not doing anything.
* Warlock now gives 20% DoT lifesteal instead of 80%. Yeah I don't really know what I was thinking. I made this before the DoT buffs, okay?
* Magical Life now gives -20% multi to health instead of -25% multi to magic shield for reasons similar to above. It also now only gives 20% cooldown reduction instead of 25%.
* Pacifist now gives 30% FLAT heal power instead of multi, and -30% FLAT spell power instead of -90% multi.
* Reckless Blows now gives 25% FLAT penetration rather than multi. It now gives -30% multi also to dodge and magic shield.
* Ruthless now gives 40% DoT damage instead of 50%. It also gives -25% spell damage instead of -30%.
* Steady Hand now gives 20% more damage, down from 25%.
* Vampire now give a FLAT 6% attack lifesteal and 3% spell lifesteal instead of giving multi. This was a good node but only after investing enough points. I want this to be impactful early game as well.
* Changed the Talent Tree major elemental weapon damage nodes to big. So that's 60% -> 30%. 60% is crazy.
* Changed the Talent Tree weapon nodes at the bottom of the tree from big to major.
* Changed some Talent Tree mana nodes from big to small, and major to big.
* Increased magic shield and magic shield regen Talent Tree node effectiveness.

* Poison Balls now has higher physical attack scaling.
* Poisoned Weapons now gives a little more nature attack damage.
* Thorn Armor synergy, Thorny Armor, has been renamed to Spiked Armor.

* Hunting Potion cooldown now reduces at double the rate per level.

* Changed the sound of out of mana or energy to that of a villager to make it more OBVIOUS you're OOM.
* Reworded some of the reset potions to make more sense.

3.10.0:
* New damage type: Attack Spells. These can trigger "on-attack" effects such as Poisoned Weapon's synergy, or Frozen/Petrify on-attack effects. They are also still affected by changes to spell damage.
* Previous spells such as Whirlwind, Martyrdom, Retribution, Tidal Waves, Flame Blitz, etc., are now Attack Spells.
* All Hunting spells that use arrows are now classified as Attack Spells.
* Hunting spells that use arrows are now properly physical damage. They can still deal elemental damage with the new "attack spell damage type".
* Spells that previously scaled off of all attack damage now scale off of physical attack damage only. Elemental attack damage will now apply separately instead of being converted into a single element. This is technically a small nerf late-game as you can't really "double-dip" for spells that converted from all elements -> one element. But should be unchanged early game. Plus, with the new damage type... Melee and Archery got buffed pretty hard late game.
* Spell tooltips have been revamped to clearly indicate whether something is a Attack Spell, Spell, etc.
* Spell tooltips now show "tags" to give players a better idea of what to expect from the spell.

* Cleaned up Judgment effect tooltip.
* Fixed Battery Fusillade not going on cooldown when canceled.

* Cleared up tooltip info regarding spells and attacks.
* Renamed Fireball to Fire Ball, Tidal Wave to Tidal Waves, and Frostball to Ice Bolt.

3.9.18:
* Oops, forgot to add tooltip indicators for which damage is DoT damage. Currently only Wounds, Burn, Thorns, and Bleed.

3.9.17:
* Medium-sized talent tree update: some areas of the tree have been reworked to incorporate FOUR new gamechanger perks, and a new perk type. A lot of the changes are top-right heavy. Some general balance changes have also been made.
* New Perk/Stat type: Increased Damage over Time Damage - this affects DoT effects ONLY (not spells like Blizzard). Currently, this means Burn, Thorns, Wounds, and Bleed. These perks can be found throughout the tree.
* New Stat: DoT Lifesteal - steals HP from DoT effects. Before, when effects such as Burn were considered spell damage, it was possible to leech from those effects. This is meant as a replacement, but currently there is only one way to get it (Warlock node).
* New Gamechanger Node: Ruthless - Increases DoT damage, but reduces spell damage.
* New Gamechanger Node: Warlock - gives your DoTs a HUGE lifesteal effect and slightly increases DoT damage at the expense of your health and magic shield.
* New Gamechanger Node: Side Step - provides bonuses to dodge and spell dodge at the expense of armor, magic shield, and block chance.
* New Gamechanger Node: Power Overwhelming - provides a large bonus to spell damage, but removes chance to crit.
* Changed percent infusion on the tree to flat infusion.
* Small buff to weapon damage talent nodes from 5% -> 6%.
* Small buff to weapon elemental damage talent nodes from 8% -> 12%.
* Small buff to phys damage talent nodes from 3% -> 8%. This apparently only affects basic attack physical damage. No wonder physical late game was so bad!
* Changed a lot of the phys damage talent nodes to apply to ALL phys damage.
* Added a FEW energy regen nodes around the tree. I realized that energy shouldn't be specific to bottom-right as everyone uses it.
* Collapsed some really large elemental wheels (mostly top of tree) into smaller combined wheels to make space for other effects.
* New Synergy for Spell Blade: Flame Blade - causes basic attacks to deal AOE fire damage upon hitting an enemy while under the effects of Spell Blade.
* Spell Blade and Poisoned Weapons have received major buffs.
* Holy Retribution and Poison Thorn Seeker are now affected by increase spell damage stats.
* Bleed now deals 25% of your weapon damage per stack, up from 8%! I realized even 64% of weapon damage per second is not very good. Now be rewarded when you apply max stacks. :)
* Reduced the duration of Bleed from 8s -> 6s.
* Reduced damage of Burn at max level by about 9%.
* Increased max stacks of Burn from 4 -> 6.
* Burn now always ticks every second and does not scale per level.
* Increased the damage of Thorns by some amount.
* Increased max stacks of Thorns from 10 -> 12.
* Thorns now always ticks every 2 seconds and does not scale per level.
* Increased duration of Thorns and Burn.
* Wounds now scales with attack damage instead of having a base damage. This should make it actually worthwhile to apply, as 3 stacks are applied at once with Recoil Shot.
* Wounds now always ticks every second and does not scale per level.
* Wounds now reduces health regeneration rather than heal power.
* Battery Fusilade's Overcharge radius increases with level.
* Fixed Wounds not applying multiple stacks at once.
* Fixed a bug where Wounds was lasting much longer than it was supposed to.
* Fixed Bleed mastery not working properly.
* Added a death message for custom_damage.
* Improved tooltips for some of the conversion stats.
* Added extra tooltip info for some spells.
* Fixed some missing localization.

3.9.16:
* Fixed effects not actually applying to enemies/allies... This whole time buffs and curses didn't even work as intended!!!
* Damage from allies should no longer affect magic shield!
* Managed to get the stack effects working again! That means effects like Burn, Thorns, Bleed now have more than a max stack of 1, and stacking the effect will increase the stat and damage effects! Most of the effects have been reworked (and in most cases, buffed).
* An example of above: Bleed now has a max of 8 stacks, and instead of doing 25% of your phys damage per second, you do 8% per stack for a max of 64% (yes this is also a huge buff).
* Buff spells now apply to allies only and not enemies. Yeah, I know.
* Effect levels can now have points put into them starting at level 5. It didn't make sense to be able to Burn enemies at level 5, but the Burn effect itself did nothing till level 10.
* Defend armor buff has been nerfed by 20%.
* Frost Shield now has a longer cooldown but also applies Magic Shield Regen.
* Reduced the power, increased the cooldown of Retribution - especially the early game.
* Increased number of projectiles at max level for Retribution.
* Fires of Judgment now gives Purifying Fires a chance to apply Judgment instead of dealing extra damage to targets with Judgment.
* Holy Retribution now provides extra armor scaling to damage if target has Judgment instead of giving Retribution the chance to apply Judgment.
* Judgment is now a skillable passive rather than being tied to Spear of Judgment.
* Judgment now scales alone rather than off of the Spear of Judgment spell.
* Burn, Thorns are now DOT damage type and not spell damage type.
* Revamped Spell GUI a bit - colour of text now indicates whether you cannot put points, have points in it, or are receiving + bonus level to spells. Also, unavailable spells no longer have a "red background" and instead have lower saturation.
* Completely new set of spell icons thanks to Skullbushi! Check out their work here: https://www.instagram.com/skullbushi/

3.9.15:
* Improved late-game all melee spells significantly.

* Many melee spells have had their max level increased.
* The cooldown of many melee spells has decreased.

3.9.14:
* Fixed Charge spell not being registered.
* Magma Flower heal synergy has been improved.
* Increased saturation of GUI bar elements.
* Swapped colour for energy bar and EXP bar.
* Changed colour of mana and magic shield to keep it more consistent. Magic Shield = Aqua, Mana = Blue.
* Magic Shield overlay now doesn't completely overlap the health bar. Now you can see how much HP you're losing due to environmental effects (no more random deaths?).
* Arcane Devotion is now a -95% multi to HP instead of -1000%. Users should be able to "counterplay" environmental effects rather than being killed with no way out.
* Battery Fusilade's Overcharge synergy now has an AOE of 1, down from 2.
* Exert now grants arrows with an AOE of 1, down from 2.
* Reworded Magma Flower synergies.

3.9.13:
* New Divine Spell: Wish - heal that scales off mana, instantly heals allies around you in a very large AOE.
* New Divine Spell: Charge - run through enemies and deal damage.
* New Divine Spell: Defend - apply a short buff on nearby allies, granting a large boost to armor.
* New Fire Spell: Steam Cloud - emit steam from your body, damaging nearby enemies for a brief duration.
* New Ocean Spell: Chilling Field - summon a small field of frost, slowly damaging enemies and applying Chilled. This spell scales slowly with your mana value.
* New Ocean Spell: Magic Burst - deal damage to nearby enemies based on your magic shield.
* Heart of Ice synergy now increases heal for all healed rather than just the user.
* Healing Wave now heals in a cone in front rather than around the user.
* Lightning Dash now costs MUCH less mana at max level, and has had its cooldown reduced from 4s to 3s.
* Reduced the mana cost of most Nature spells.
* Leveling Poison Cloud reduces its cast time more per level.
* Increased Spear of Judgment damage value.
* Added swing on arm cast to most spells that were missing it.
* Area of Effect is now a float rather than int. Before, 2.9 radius was the same as 2.0.

3.9.12:
* New Nature Spell: Rock Slide - a spell that summons a rock barrage on enemies.
* New Fire Spell: Lava Quake - a cone AoE melee spell.
* New Hunting Spell: Exert - similar to Imbue, buffs your arrow spells. But instead of adding damage, arrows will explode on contact and do half damage in a small area. This effect CAN stack with Imbue.
* New Synergy for Rock Slide: Stone Sharpnel - turns Rock Slide into a "storm" spell.
* New Synergy for Battery Fusilade: Overcharge - projectiles release a small AoE upon hitting an enemy.
* Dash now propels you twice as fast/far.
* Lightning Spear mana cost reduced slightly.
* Fire Ball now travels almost 3x faster and lasts 1 second instead of 3 seconds. It should feel a lot more responsive to use now.
* Poison Ball now shoots 3 projectiles instead of 1, and travels much slower. I want to give each "ball" spell more identity.
* Corrosive Shadow, Thought Seize, Mortality Sap, Poison Cloud, Gorgon's Gaze, and Freeze can no longer affect allies.
* Reduced number of arrows per wave of Arrow Storm.
* Imbue now provides less of a damage boost.
* You can now learn Spell Blade 5 mastery levels earlier.
* You can now learn the Trap spells earlier.

3.9.11:
* Tidal Wave and Retribution no longer pierce. They have been buffed accordingly to compensate for the unintended multi-hit effect.
* Whirlpool now correctly does frost damage instead of elemental damage.
* Fixed Elemental Damage not being converted properly with Ele to Physical Conversion.
* Regeneneration typo.

3.9.10:s
* Buffed weapon damage and elemental weapon damage nodes on the tree.
* Fixed the new nodes on the left.

3.9.9:
* Mastery now scales 1:1 with your max level instead of scaling based on your max level. This also means that spells scale with your total mastery level rather than the mastery level of the tree, encouraging dual-mastery spec. Previously, they scaled at approximately your mastery level * 2 for each individual mastery (capped at about half your max level, so level 10 Fire would be the max for a player level 20, and would scale to level 20). Now, you need 20 points in Fire mastery in order for spells to scale to player level 20. That also means at level 60, you'd need 50 points in Fire (max), and 10 points in another tree to fully scale. Fundamentally, this allows players to go mono-spec and not be punished for allocating all their points into one tree until level 50, where they will probably need to spec into another tree. Additionally, this means that spells will be faster to obtain without punishment - you can get Volcano at level 50, instead of losing on potential stats if you "rushed" for it previously.
* You can no longer allocate points into your mastery level so that your total mastery level is higher than your max level.
* The previous mastery system just seemed uninuitive to new players. Most would want to specialize in just one tree, so with the new change, you can do that, and still be rewarded for going dual-spec. Of course, by level 51 you'll need to be speccing into 2 different trees anyway.
* New synergies for: Lightning Totem, Charged Nova, Blast Trap.
* Substantially reduced the cooldown of ALL spells except for the "ultimate" spells.
* Tidal Wave now pierces enemies.
* Increased shoot speed of Tidal Wave.
* Increased damage of Purifying Fires.
* Increased heal of Healing Wave.
* Healing Wave now casts instantly.
* Increased damage of "ultimate" spells (except Volcano).
* Synergies Charged Storm, Magma Bloom, and Piercing Winds have been reworked slightly to augment the spell rather than straight up improve it.
* Fixed a missing item word.
* Hopefully fixed zombies spawning like crazy on top of map dungeons.

3.9.8:
* Fixed Lightning Essence being given to enemies rather than the player...
* Fixed Power Surge and Quick Surge not giving elemental damage.
* Improved some tooltip descriptions.

3.9.7:
* Fixed new nodes giving lifesteal instead of the new gain stat.

3.9.6:
* Bravery health and block chance has been improved.
* Trickery critical hit has been improved.
* Divine auras provide a little more of their core stat.
* New stats: Physical to Fire/Nature/Lightning/Frost Weapon Damage stat, which ADDS % of physical damage as elemental attack damage.
* New stat: Elemental to Physical Conversion, which converts all elemental weapon damage into physical damage.
* Shifted some talents around on the tree.
* Increased the effectiveness of many nodes on the tree: elemental nodes, physical damage nodes, spell damage nodes, heal power nodes. Also improved weapon and elemental weapon damage nodes.
* New keystone talent on the warrior branch: Berserker's Impartiality. Converts half of your elemental damage into physical damage.
* New nodes on the left side of the tree which add 25% of physical weapon damage gained as [insert element] weapon damage.
* Bleed from the Bleed Mastery passive now lasts 8 seconds, up from 3.
* Bleed from the Bleed Mastery passive now does 25% of your physical weapon damage, up from 15%.
* Fixed a localization error.
* Hopefully improved the responsiveness of Dash and Thunder, also the weird error where the two spells become non-responsive has hopefully been fixed.
* Increased distance of Thunder Dash, and increased its area of effect.
* Reduced mana scaling of Battery Fusillade by a flat 1% at max level (8% -> 7%).
* Retribution now lasts only 2 seconds but slowly increases back to 3 seconds, down from a flat 3 seconds at all levels.
* Retribution now pierces through enemies - it will continue to hit enemies beyond the first.
* Retribution is no longer affected by gravity.
* Blazing Inferno now scales of off all weapon damage rather than just fire weapon damage - I missed this last time.
* Spell Blade now provides 25% Fire Infusion, and provides "gain 25% of your physical damage as fire weapon damage". That's a straight up 25% increase in attack damage!
* Poisoned Weapons no longer provides a measly flat nature attack damage boost, but turns at least 50% of your physical damage to nature weapon damage, and then provides a small nature weapon damage bonus.
* Tick rate of Ice Orb has been reduced slightly at max level (nerf).
* Reduced attack scaling of Tidal Wave by a flat 10%.
* Tidal Wave now casts 2 -> 3 times rather than 3 -> 4.
* Tidal Wave now has a static 1 second channeling time.

3.9.5:
* Ice Orb now passes through enemies and deals extra damage to enemies it passes through.
* Ice Orb tick rate has been nearly doubled.
* Stout Defender now provides 50% increased block chance instead of 100%.
* Changed some armor nodes into block nodes and vice-versa.

3.9.4:
* Cleaned up some party code.
* Commented out some debugging stuff.
* Fixed the tooltip of Mana Battery. It reduces damage by 50%, not 25%.
-----BALANCE CHANGES-----
Stats and Traits:
* Major change to how block works. It now has a % chance to block damage fully, rather than blocking a flat amount of damage. Additionally, if you have your shield up but your block fails, you will still reduce damage by 25%. This is (imo) a major improvement to how shields worked before, and falls in line with how blocking works in other ARPGs.
* Critical hit and critical damage should now be slightly easier to stack.
* Dodge rating and armor now max out at 95%, up from 90% and 80%, respectively. Because of how these stats are calculated, this also means it is 5.55% and 18.75% easier to stack the respective stats (huge buff for armor).
* Dodge rating and armor stats are now slightly more effective, except max dodge rating percent has been reduced by 4%.
* Health regen, magic shield, and magic shield regen stat values have been increased slightly.
* Health flat stat values have been decreased slightly.

* BUFF: Stout Defender now has a -25% multi on stats from -30%.

* Reduced critical hit bonus from Silent Wind from 10% -> 7%.
* Reduced movement speed penalty from Silent Wind by 40%.

* Increased initial base value of Thunderstorm.
* Thunderstorm Enhanced synergy is now much more efficient per point.

3.9.3:
* Reduced strength of bosses.
* Bosses now spawn epic mobs instead of "minions" which was causing problems with minion summons.
* Equipping gear that gives + skills will no longer remove skill points from your tree (no more negative skill points available fix).
* There is a new stat that gives + all skills (only already allocated skills) - this stat is currently only accessible via modifying the datapacks, it is not available on any gear.
* The max bonus level for spells is now the max level * 2, rather than max level + 5. That means for example, Healing Wave can go up to level 32 from 16, instead of 21 from 16. This can be achieved from plus skill stats.

3.9.2:
* Fixed bug where users were getting no experience when playing alone.

3.9.1:
* Changed the Spell Blade effect from infusion to flat elemental weapon damage. Realistically, no one went for elemental spell damage in all elements so this spell was not very relevant.
* Increased the effectiveness of Nourishment and Ice Blade, and increased duration of all Ocean buffs slightly at earlier levels.
* Increased attack scaling and fire attack scaling of the "attack" spells in the Fire tree.
* Increased armor attack scaling of Retribution at earlier levels.
* Increased the early game health scaling of Martyrdom, but reduced the max health scaling by max level (by like 1%).
* Increased the mana cost of Martyrdom at later levels.
* Increased Spear of Judgment attack scaling.
* Increased healing values of Holy Flower.
* Increased the effectiveness of the Nature curses.
* Reduced base value of Nature Balm at max level slightly.
* Increased early game attack scaling of Poison Ball greatly.
* Reduced base value of Poison Ball.
* Reduced regeneration amounts from Bravery, Trickery, and Wizardry.

3.9.0:
* Party command now handles all of the party stuff - you no longer need to use /team!
* Hitting a party member will no longer knock them back.

3.8.22:
* Increased effectiveness of Healing Wave at higher levels.

3.8.21:
* Fixed Pacifist node.

3.8.20:
* Renamed Frost to Chilled to help prevent confusion between it and Frozen effects.
* Fixed Nature scaling not scaling properly.
* Made a lot of the tooltips more clear.

3.8.19:
* Changed Pacifist to reduce spell damage by a flat amount rather than a multi. This was causing some confusion becuase players thought their spell damage would decrease by half.
* Added stats to plate and leather uniques that were missing.

3.8.18:
Many of the changes below were to help the early-late game imbalance caused from some of the recent updates.
* Changed Whirlwind to scale off ALL weapon damage, NOT just physical.
* Reduced scaling of Whirlwind. In general this will benefit most builds.
* Increased base damage of Lightning Totem across the board.
* Increased base damage of Lightning Spear at early levels.
* Lowered base damage of Lightning Spear at max level by about 6%.
* Reduced the base damage of Burn at max level by about 8%.
* Doubled magic shield value from Frost Shield.
* Greatly increased the frost damage from basic attacks when enemies are frozen.
* Ice Blade now provides 25% more frost weapon damage.
* You now get 33% more regen from Cold Essence.
* Reduced the base value of all Hunting arrow skills.
* Reduced attack scaling of all Hunting arrow skills and Blast Trap, especially at earlier levels (max level remains more or less unchanged).
* Increased energy cost of Crossbows and Bows slightly.
Change to Mapping/Mobs:
* Mob rarities have been reworked in terms of rewards and stats. They are slightly harder now towards the upper rarities.
* A lot of players weren't aware that there were different boss types. Hopefully, the changes to difficulty of bosses and the change in summons will make it more inuitive. The 4 boss types: Berserker (speeds up when damaged), Necromancer, Hell Lord, and Replicator (the last 3 summon).
* Different boss types have been given identifying particle types. They previously only had witch particles.
* Bosses have had their rewards and difficulties increased GREATLY.
* Boss summons have been changed from Legendary rarity to Minion rarity, which is essentially between epic and legendary, but provides experience equivalent to an epic mob. this is about 30% of the experience they used to get. Farming the summons was too broken, so I've tried to shift it off the minions to the bosses so on average you will still get a lot of experience.
Fixes:
* Probably fixed a bug where custom dimension tiers weren't being applied properly... probably.
* Elemental resists on the talent tree now provide flat resists rather than increased resistances.

3.8.17:
* Increased rate at which gear is modified/repaired, etc.
* Hopefully fixed a dupe bug occuring rarely with the modify station.

3.8.16:
* Staves give flat spell damage instead of percent, this was how it was always supposed to be!
* Fixed spell lifesteal and lifesteal not working correctly.
* Increased lifesteal amounts from Draconic and Vampiric Blood.
* Reduced mana scaling and projectile speed of Battery Fusilade at higher levels. Increased cooldown very slightly.
* New game changer node: Fortified Reaction - converts dodge into armor, but multi dodge -25%. Located on the right side of the talent tree.
* New game changer node: Pacifist - greatly increases heal power and reduces cooldowns, but deal 50% less spell damage. Located on the top-left side of the talent tree.
* New game changer node: Vampire - gives a large lifesteal and spell lifesteal multiplier, but makes you lose all health regen. Located on the bottom-left side of the talent tree.
* New game changer node: Stout Defender - gives a huge amount of block while reducing some other defensive stats. Located on the left side of the talent tree.
* Moved Steady Hand to the bottom side of the talent tree.
* Added a ring in the center of the tree to improve options for pathing to the other side of the tree. I tried to make it not too "easy" so it'll still require a decent amount of points.
* Added some cooldown reduction and heal power nodes sporadically around the tree (weighted to the left).
* Added some node connectors in the middle of the left side of the talent tree to improve pathing a bit.
* Reduced effectiveness of the Magical Life node - the node now also gives -25% multi magic shield.
* Mana Battery now reduces armor as well, but reduces health, armor and dodge at a lower amount than previously.
* Familiar Instincts now reduces health regeneration even further.
* Made some tooltip text a little more clearer.
* Reduced slow % from Frost effect. The way slow was calculated, zombies would be straight up freeze in place with 40%.
* Rare crash with tridents should be fixed.
* Actually fixed dodge and shield sounds from not playing!!!
* Dodging now prevents knockback. Doesn't make sense to go flying if you've dodged the attack...

3.8.15:
* Defensive Root no longer lasts 100 seconds (lol). lasts ~10 seconds like it was supposed to.
* Defensive Root has been reworking into Natural Empowering, which instead of providing a defense bonus, briefly increases base attack speed and energy regeneration.
* Critical damage nodes from the tree have been reduced slightly.
* Lowered movement speed reduction when casting spells.
* Lowered healing amount from Heart of Ice at higher levels by about 25%.
* Increased healing amount from Healing Aura by about 33%. Also lowered cooldown slightly.
* New chaos stat which applies speed buff on crit 50% of the time.
The following changes were made to give magic shield more identity vs. health, as well as making gameplay feel a bit smoother:
* Fixed a bug where HP/MS regen was adding more exhaustion than intended when restoring less than the max amount.
* You will now regen as long as you are above 15 hunger, instead of 18.
* Health, mana, and energy now regen every 3 seconds, down from 5. This should make regeneration feel a little smoother.
* Regen values for health, mana, and energy have been reduced to compliment the above change. You should regenerate approximately the same amount on average.
* Magic shield now only regens every 10 seconds, up from 5.
* Magic shield no longer adds exhaustion.
* Reduced magic shield flat stat effectiveness by 25%.
* Increased magic shield regeneration stat effectiveness greatly. Basically, you will regenerate more magic shield, and you can have higher pools of magic shield, but you will lack methods of instant recovery and will have to wait a while for it to regenerate. This basically makes it better for one shots but worse for prolonged battles.
* The Harmony trait used to split HP restoration effects with 50% going to health, and 25% going to magic shield. It now splits it 33%/33% between the two resources.

3.8.14:
* Hotfix for Battery Fusilade.
* Hotfix for party command spam lel

3.8.13:
* Hotfix for Flame Blitz.

3.8.12:
New Skills:
* New Hunting skills: the following AOE trap spells can be placed and are triggered upon enemy entry: Snare Trap (prevents enemy movement), Blast Trap (does damage), Enfeeble Trap (weakens enemy armor and resistances).
* New Fire skills: Flame Blitz (rapidly strike in melee range, scales from weapon damage), Draconic Blood & Vampiric Blood (team buff that gives spell/attack lifeleech, respectively), Spell Blade (gives caster a high amount of elemental infusion for a short period of time).
* New Storm skills: Critical and Power Surge (increases crit chance and reduces ele dmg, increases ele dmg and reduces crit chance, respectively), Quick Charge (team buff that reduces cooldowns but increases mana cost), Battery Fusilade (unload your mana to deal damage based on your total mana with multiple projectiles).
* New Nature skills: Root - root yourself in place to bolster your defenses. The following curses apply in AOE, have no cast time and have low cooldown (their effects are not as powerful, because of this): Corrosive Shadow (lowers enemy movement speed, armor, and dodge), Mortality Sap (lowers enemy critical hit chance and damage), Thought Seize (lowers enemy magic shield regen, mana regen, and resists).
* Throw Flames has been renamed as Meteoric Strike and has been reworked to not be a channel spell anymore.

The following few changes were made to improve mixing different spell trees:
* Instead of having Cold Essence increase your frost damage (which only benefits the Ocean tree), it now provides a small amount of mana and energy regen (which benefits all builds).
* Tidal Wave's Freezing Waves no longer consumes Frost Essence and just does extra damage if the enemy is Frosted.
* Whirlpool's synergy has been changed to Rejuvenating Pool which applies the new Cold Essence.
* The Shiver effect is now obsolete/unused. With the new changes, elemental resist reduction has been moved off of Ocean, which now focuses more on sustain and utility. Additionally, it seemed sort of redundant to have so many Ocean effects with similar names.
* Thorns no longer reduces fire resist and now reduces healing power and health regen slightly.
* Burn now reduces ALL elemental resists by 5% instead of reducing frost resist by 20%.
* Frost now reduces elemental damage by 10% instead of reducing lightning resist. It now also slows by 40% instead of 50%.
* Static now reduces ALL elemental resists by 20% instead of nature/lightning.
* Lightning Essence now provides 20% to ALL elemental SPELL damage rather than just all lightning damage. It now also provides 40% less critical hit chance than previously (5% -> 3%), but this is because the new lightning skill adds quite a lot.

Other Balance Changes:
* Martyrdom and Retribution have been changed to physical damage type.
* A bunch of skills have had their max level reduced to compensate for the increased number of skills. This does mean however, that some of them are not as strong as they used to be at max level. I did this because players were unable to invest in two trees.
* True Hit now grants a 25% Crit Chance Multiplier rather than 20% Crit Damage Multiplier.
* Whirlwind base scaling values have been reduced at earlier levels but remains similar to what it was before at max level.
* Fixed Poison Cloud spamming console.
* Spell effects such as Burn now show the appropriate element (fire in this case).
* Added back buttons to the GUI where appropriate. No more pressing ESC and then H!
* Party commands now provide text feedback.
* Fixed some tooltip errors with some currency.
* Fixed an issue with Blazing Inferno, Charged Nova, Poison Cloud, and Whirlwind where you could reset their cooldowns for free.
* Increased damage of Ice Orb by 33% at early levels, and about 12.5% at max level.
* Nourishment grants 20% more health regeneration.
* Fixed a bug where Blizzard was freezing the user instead of mobs...
* Whirlwind no longer knocks back enemies.
* Purifying Flames and Martyrdom now knockback enemies.
* Recoil of Hunter now provides 1 stack on cast instead of 3, which makes sense because the max stack is 1 anyway. Consequently, the max level for the synergy is now 1.
* You now receive more critical damage and less dodge from Hunter Instinct.
* You now receive a lot more dodge from Wind Walk.
* Added some new hybrid elemental damage mob suffixes.
* You now move twice as slow as you would before while casting spells.

3.8.11:
* New stat: Spell Lifesteal! Lifesteal, but for spells!
* Added lifesteal and spell lifesteal nodes to the tree.
* Life/spell lifesteal now has a minimum of 1. So even if you do 6 damage with 1% lifesteal, you will still heal 1 HP.
* Major Arcana stat "Judgment" now provides spell lifesteal, and the "thirst of" affixes provide a minor amount of spell lifesteal instead of lifesteal.
* Increased crit hit and damage percents and multis, flat values are still the same.
* Nature's Balm has had its values readjusted again (buff).
* Flat physical damage values have been lowered, but percent has been increased. This means physical will about 20% less damage early game, but investing into physical damage will improve it about 30% more.
* Increased early game effectiveness of Retribution.
* Fixed some localization typos and made some stats/skills more clear. "Judgment" is now spelled correctly, yay!
* Plate gear now also provides armor.
* Leather gear provides a bit less HP.
* Increased durability of equipment, especially at lower rarities.
* Lessened the effect of gear damage on loot drop at lower levels. You will still definitely feel this at higher levels.
* Vanilla ores provide a little more fuel than they used to.
* Setting tiers in the Dimension Config should work now.

3.8.10:
* Added a new Hunting Skill: Hunter's Potion, instantly recover % HP on a long cooldown.
* I went a little too far, re-added some benefits to the core stats.
* Improved the spell damage percent mod max roll by 50%.
* Changed the max level of some Hunting skills.
* You now can unlock the Wind spells 5 mastery levels earlier.
* Improved the Wind spells.
* Reduced cooldown of Retribution.

3.8.9:
* An issue with skill rotation was that it required too many points into other secondary skills (Fire Bombs, Charged Nova, etc.) in order for them to be even useful. The initial cooldowns were too great, but were more or less fine at max level. To combat this, level 1 cooldowns for almost ALL spells has been reduced significantly, and max level cooldown remains more or less untouched.
* Ball + Thunder Spear spells have been slightly readjusted again, their early game effectiveness has been improved.
* The above changes also mean that you will see slightly less benefits to putting points into one spell, but is still useful to do so. It encourages branching out as well!
* Silent Wind movement speed reduction has been lowered.
* Nature's Balm has been reduced in effectiveness.

3.8.8:
* You will need to reset your skills after updating to this version!
* The goal of the following changes was to offset some of the power players were getting from raw stats. Now, it is more encouraged to split into two trees. Especially since there are more buffs available now.
* Core stats have been reworked. They now give much less benefits than previously.
* Ocean Tree and Divine Tree have been reworked heavily, there are 4 new skills for the Ocean Tree!
* Too many changes for Ocean Tree... TL;DR there are new buff skills and healing has been changed to heal over time.
* Hunting Tree now has 2 new buffs known as "Winds", you can activate only one of them at a time.
* Heart of Ice has been completely changed. It now works more like the old Healing Aura from the Divine Tree, which has also been reworked into a spammable.
* New Frozen effect that can be applied by a new Ocean skill - Arctic Breath (including Blizzard). Frozen enemies take additional damage when basic attacked and cannot move.
* Heavy Strike has been changed to Martyrdom - it now scales off of HP instead of weapon damage.
* Ground Slam has been changed to Retribution - it now scales off of armor instead of weapon damage.
* Some tooltip clarifications have been made.
* Casting spells no longer damages the item you are holding.
* Repair values have been ever so slightly increased. Common ore is still bad.
* Fixed localization error on Crystal of Ascension.
* Reduced Crit Multi of True Hits perk to 20%, from 30%.
* Reduced the power of Critical Hits/Damage substantially.
* Reduced effectiveness of penetration slightly.
* Reduced the power of Fire Bombs and Burn effect by about 25-33%.
* Reduced the power of ball spells and Thunder Spear very slightly.
* Divine auras now require varying mastery levels. They have had their values shifted slightly, as well.
* Added an HP multiplier config to dimension configs.
* There have been other minor adjustments that have not been logged.

3.8.7:
* Reduced mana cost and cooldown of Whirlwind, and very slightly reduced damage scaling.
* Map drop rate bonus when in maps has been increased from 4% --> 15%.
* Crystal of Ascension now has a level of 15 levels instead of 10.
* Stone of Corruption now increases an item's level by 5 rather than 2.

3.8.6:
* Fixed the Nether wart farm room not spawning in correctly, leaving players with an impossible map.

3.8.5:
* Inconsistencies in element naming has been fixed. Nature = Nature, Ocean = Frost, Storm = Lightning.
* Fixed some missing localization.
* Updated Divine Tree description to better reflect what it has become.

3.8.4:
* Mob experience on kill no longer takes into account only the highest damage from player, but rather from all players. Before, a mob with 12 HP could have taken 6 environment damage, 4 damage from player A, and 2 damage from player B, but distribute no experience because player A's 4 dmg < 6. Now, it'll still attribute the kill to player A, but will take into account all player damage, so 4 + 2 = 6 which is at least 50% of the mob's health. This should make party play feel a LOT better.
* You now receive an additional 20% experience for each member on the team. So 2 players get 120% / 2 = 60% per person, 3 players get 140% / 3 = 47% per person, etc.
* Fixed block sounds being played on bleed.
* You now must use a pickaxe to mine ores.
* You now require at least a stone pickaxe to mine ores.
* Ore blocks now use datapacks and can be smelted down into ores if mined with Silk Touch. This is particularly useful in enabling compatibilty with technology mods.
* Ore world gen rates for ores have been increased very slightly.
* Made it very slightly easier for players to get the kill when compared against environment damage.
Balance Changes:
* Increased cooldown of "ball" spells by 1s. Thunder Spear's cooldown was increased by 0.5s.
* The following changes were made to make Fire feel more consistent:
* Increased mana cost of Fireball at max level by ~9%.
* Doubled Burn proc. chance for Fire spells.
* Reduced damage of Burn by ~55%.
* Reduced tick rate and duration of Burn at max level slightly.
* Increased Thunder Spear damage by ~20%.
* Increased Static proc. chance for Lightning Totem.
* Ice Orb has more pretty particles.
* Increased cooldown of Heavy Strike by 1s.
* Increased attack scaling of Ground Slam by 20% at max level.
* Increased cooldown of Ground Slam by 1s at max level.

3.8.3:
* You should be able to interact with most gravestone mods in maps now.
* Dank Storage is now retrievable in maps if you accidentally place one down.
* Fixed some map rooms with signs as placeholders for mobs and loot. They should now properly spawn.
* Improved consistency of Spruce Mansion redstone room.

3.8.2:
* Reduced armor reduction of Enrage slightly.
* Fixed tick rate of console spam.
* You can now interact with shulker boxes in Adventure Maps.
* Increased energy cost of weapons. The cost in general was too low and it wasn't really necessary to allocate stats into energy sustain.

3.8.1:
* Added particles to basically every spell, and increased particle count for most spells. This should help with visual acuity!
* Fixed Arrow Barrage shooting only 1 arrow.
* Went a little overboard last patch: ball spell damage has been increased very slightly again.
* Physical spells have had a minor reduction in damage.
* Cooldowns of basically ALL (except ball) spells has been reduced GREATLY. I'm pushing spell rotation over spamming one spell!
* Increased chance to proc effects for some spells.

3.8.0:
* All weapons now roll different secondary stats. Melee weapons no longer have any weapon damage multiplier - axes no longer do double damage. Energy cost has been changed to reflect this, and the addition of new secondary stats should more than make up for this. The reason for this change was because spells didn't take into account the weapon damage multiplier. Ergo, physical spells should feel _much_ better to use now with all melee weapons. Bows and crossbows more or less remain unchanged (slightly reduced damage with addition of new stats).
* New Ocean spell: Ice Orb - shoot an orb of ice that sprays enemies in its path.
* New Nature spell: Poison Cloud - applies Thorns to nearby enemies (large AOE).
* New Hunting spell: Dash - literally a dash.
* New Physical effect: Enrage - makes enemies move fast and deal more damage, but take increased damage.
The following spell changes were made for a few reasons. Mages were a little too strong for the amount of investment they had to make. Also, a lot of builds devolved into ball spam, and other "stronger" and utility-based spells were not seeing as much play.
* Ball spells are now affected by cooldown but have had their cooldown increased. Their cooldowns are also now fixed and will not change upon leveling them.
* Ball spells and Thunder Spear have had their damage reduced by a lot. Emphasis is on skill rotation now.
* Hunting spells no longer have any cast time and have been greatly improved.
* Reduced max projectile count of Ground Slam.
* Physical spells have had their damage increased.
* Heavy Strike and Whirlwind have new synergies.
* Magma Flower's duration has increased, and mana cost decreased.
* Nature spells have been greatly improved (Gorgon's Gaze is actually good) and are more geared towards weapon damage --> spell damage rather than a weird hybrid.
* Nature's Balm healing has increased slightly.
* Storm and Ocean spells have been reduced in power slightly, while Fire has seen a general buff.
* All stack effects (Thorns, Burn, etc.) have been reworked. There is an issue with stacks that need to be fixed but in the meantime this band-aid fix should suffice.

3.7.9:
* Fixed incorrect synergy icon/text for Frostball.
* Fixed all elemental spell damage stat not working.

3.7.8:
Changes were made to balance physical vs. elemental spells. Elemental spells are more or less the same but investing into them should be a lot more rewarding. I tried to make it more viable to go for elemental builds over the current OP physical builds. As always, my goal is to slowly improve the balance between the elements, and to provide each one with a unique identity. Currently, water is utility/damage since it provides many slows and can boost the power of the other elements greatly. Fire scales slightly with weapon damage and has an improved burn. Thunder is pure spell damage. Nature is tank/DoT, and Hunting is bow. Currently, Divine is split between support and physical spells.

* Fixed BossPacket console spam.

* Added some new perk nodes around the tree.
* Added armor penetration to Reckless Blows but increased armor reduction from it as well.
* Increased elemental damage reduction from Overflowing Vitality.
* Added a -15% health multi to Overflowing Vitality.
* Reduced -25% health multi to -10% health multi on Blood Mage.
* Increased 
* Slightly reduced physical damage scaling - flat values more or less remain unchanged.

* Buffed Familiar Instincts and Refreshing Breeze.
* Mana Battery now stays active for longer and absorbs four times the amount of damage.

* Reduced volume of Ground Slam.
* Reduced power of Heavy Strike.
* Reduced power and projectile count of Ground Slam slightly.
* Reduced initial strength of Whirlwind. It still retains the same power at max level.
* Increased duration of Whirlwind.
* Reduced mana cost of Whirlwind.

* Increased projectile speed very slightly for "ball" skills.
* Increased slightly the cooldown of the "ball" skills. Overall elemental skills see a reduction in cooldown though.
* Reduced mana costs of most elemental skills.
* Increased base value of most elemental skills.
* Frostball now generates Frost stacks instead of consuming them, and tidal wave consumes them instead of generating them.
* Increased attack scaling moderately on most elemental skills that have it.
* Increased power of burning effect.
* It is now much easier to generate Burn stacks using Fire Ball and Frost stacks with Frostball.
* Increased level 1 attack scaling of Thorns, max level remains the same.
* The max stacks for Frost has increased from 5 --> 10.
* The slow per stack for Frost has reduced from 8% --> 7% per stack. Overall, you can now slow enemies by 30% more.
* Shiver now reduced Fire and Thunder resistance by 50%, up from 15%.
* Static now reduces only Thunder resistance, and reduces (base value) 3% per stack, up from 1%.
* Static now has a max of 8 stacks, up from 3. The only source of Static is from Lightning Totems, which has seen a general damage nerf because of this change.

3.7.7:
* Fixed some broken nodes on tree.

3.7.6:
* COMPLETELY revamped the talent tree. There are many more paths to take now!
* Fixed Fake Players not doing damage (interaction with MineColonies).
* Added some new melee skills in the Divine Tree - Heavy Strike, Ground Slam, and Whirlwind!

Balance Changes:
* Increased duration and radius, and reduced cooldown of Blizzard, Volcano, and Thunderstorm.
* Crit effectiveness has been further reduced by a small amount.
* Defensive options have been modified a bit to give each one some more identity. Health and armor is harder to stack while magic shield and dodge is easier to stack.

3.7.5:
* Fixed bosses not summoning in maps.
* Fixed name of thunderstorm synergy.

Balance Changes:
* Increased mana cost and cooldown of Lightning Totem.
* Very slightly reduced damage, radius, and tick rate of Lightning Totem.

3.7.4:
* Changed bag recipes to use any wooden chest with the appropriate tag instead of vanilla chests.
* Reduced the effectiveness of critical hit modifiers by about 20%. Critical hits is still strong but will require a bit more investment.
* Fixed merchant dupe bug.
* Fixed boss spawn bug.
* Made some spell tooltips a bit more clear.
* Probably fixed energy not being restored with Thunder Dash.
* Reduced energy cost of bows.
* Reduced damage of bows and crossbows slightly.

Spells:
* Reduced base value of Fireball, Poison Ball, and Frostball from 7 -> 25 to 6 -> 22.

* Reduced base value of Blazing Inferno from 2 -> 10 to 2 -> 5.
* Reduced mana cost of Blazing Inferno from 30 -> 45 to 25 -> 35.
* Increased duration of Volcano from 4s -> 5s to 4s -> 6s.

Storm Tree:
* Changed some level requirements of the Storm Tree.
* Added a new skill for Storm: Charged Nova - behaves similar to Blazing Inferno but is geared towards spellcasters.
* Added a new synergy for Thunderstorm: Charged Storm which increases the tick rate and radius of Thunderstorm.
* Reduced projectile speed of Thunder Spear from 2 -> 3 to 2 -> 2.5.
* Reduced base value of Thunder Spear from 8 -> 28 to 4 -> 16. The increased projectile speed of this spell from the last buff made	made it much easier to bounce between targets.

* Reduced radius of Thunderstorm from 3 -> 6 to 3 -> 5.
* Increased tick rate of Thunderstorm from 1.5s -> 0.75s to 1.75s -> 1.25s.

Nature Tree:
* Added attack scaling to Poison Ball, Thorn Bush, and Gorgon's Gaze, and the Thorns effect. Thorns effect is now much stronger and DoT should be viable.

3.7.2:
* Filled missing localization entries.

3.7.1:
* Removed unfinished unique dungeon which fixed an issue with datapacks and CraftTweaker.
* Removed an unused method in Holy Retribution synergy causing gui errors.

3.7.0

General Changes:
* Map portals now take less time to break.

* Changed hud render to not break if experience isn't rendered.
* Small perf improvement for auto config items.
* Fix entity configs not clamping correctly if dimension is set to scale mob level to player.
* Added minion mob rarity (for boss summons so they dont drop loot).
* Fixed the "Tried to load a block entity for block Block{minecraft:air}" spam.
* Strength now increases elemental attack damage instead of all ele dmg, intelligence same but increases all elemental spell damage.
* Updated the text of some core stats to match what they actually gave.
* Fixed the formatting of the skill names so they're all capitalized properly.
* Dexterity gives 25% less critical hit per point compared to before.

All Spells:
* Increased projectile speed of all spells (except hunting spells) by 100%.
* Increased radius of totem and flower spells by 100%.
* Most spells now swing arm.
* Fix skill damage stats not working (this sounds really dumb but I forgot to make them work differently after reworking the spell system, leaving them as dummy stats,
it doesn't help that I didn't have time to play test my mod)

Divine Tree:
* Switched positions of Bravery and Wizardry.
* Bravery now grants 50% more armor and 20% more health regen than previously.

3.6.14
* fix divine buffs expiring randomly after a few seconds

3.6.13
* dungeon chests now have a chance to give vanilla items that are dictated by lootables. (meaning configurable by modpack devs)
Low lvl maps give stuff like coal, mid lvl give gold, and high lvl maps can give even diamonds!
* fixed more dungeon signs
* fix stations dupe bug

3.6.12
* implemented an experimental simple way to minimize effectiveness of mob farms (ill implement configs later, first i need to see if it works)

3.6.11
* should fix mana cost reduction throwing exception on synergies that dont cost mana.

3.6.10
* starter item config is now common config

3.6.9
* trying out performance optimizations
* added ignored entities config, this stops stat data packets from being sent to client,
 should make servers less laggy as most entities are bats and fish, and you don't really care about their stats. 
 You could also add sheep for example, if you have a huge sheep farm that's laggy.
 * orb of blessing can no longer reroll unique gear's stats
 * orb of unique blessing can now only reroll them, and the instability hit is now much higher (as unique gears are much less random now, i'm toning down the amount of times you can modify them)
* made starter items a newbie gear bag instead. the bag now gives same items every time. 

3.6.8
* updated chinese lang
* added mastery descriptions by dreckz
* added 3 new divine buff spells
* removed some advancements

3.6.7
* added a new mastery: divine!
* added new fire mastery synergy
* removed deobf jar, seemed to confuse more non modders than it helped modders
* pets shouldnt take spell damage from owners anymore

3.6.6
* removed experimental map drop rate restrictions
* effective spell level is now derived from effective mastery level.
* fix death message
* fix spell cooldown being synced wrongly when in gui
* should fix ores not generating in modded biomes

3.6.5
* fixed volcano doing only 1 hit
* buffed thorn armor and hunter instinct stats

3.6.4
* should fix possible server crash

3.6.3
* should fix some spells not going on cooldown after casting
3.6.2
* fix entrance room 

3.6.1

3.6.0

SPELL REWORK!
* spell tree has been remade into masteries.
* spells and synergies now have levels
* synergies now cost mana
* removed some spells as i consider them bad (like geyser) and others because their spell school doesn't have enough spells, they'll probably be re-added later
* added some new spells
* spell damage stats are now percents and increase spell damage by percent, instead of adding to the damage.
* infusion reworked
* added cooldown reduction, mana cost reduction and cast rate stats (they might not be used yet though, but they're there)
* added +1 to spell school levels stat
* removed elemental conversion and transfer stats, mostly useless after spell damage became a percent
* huge easy aoe spells now have much larger cooldown, added other semi aoe spells that are harder to hit and can't hit that many enemies at once.
* added a new rune that adds levels to specific spells, you'll need that for after level 45

What should happen with the rework:
* players should think more about how many points they want to spend and where
* players should decide between base stats or spell levels
* players should be able to play 2 schools of magic that use different elements without feeling useless
* magic should be less op at endgame and more useful at early game.
* aoe clearing a bunch of mobs should be much harder to do, especially from range, as high aoe spells are under long cooldown

If the system didn't make some of these happen, please tell me about it.

Other:
* bosses now spawn less minions but they're all max rarity
* blocking fully now stops attack knockbacks. can't figure out how to stop the attack sounds though
* made vanilla teams usable for exp and friendly fire off.
* casting spells now slows you down
* server performance improvements (syncing mob stat packets to client should lag server less now as i almost cut down the packet size in half)
* added all the buildathon rewards that people asked for (still many didn't come claim them though)
* fixed unique cangetset field not doing anything in datapacks
* mobs now have a small chance to increase their own rarity and level by killing other mobs. (experimental feature but i think it will be good)
* decreased default regen hunger cost
* made weapon costs scale with weapon level. This is experimental until i see if it can be abused or not. If people find some way of using lvl 1 weapons to do a lot of damage 
then i'll have to switch back to scaling costs to player level.
* spells levels now dictate their damage and mana costs too. To get maximum player level of spell effectiveness you'll need +1 to skill level gear stats. (5 or 6 of them)
* added new affixes and runeword.
* increase default stat points per lvl
* as talents pic is no longer 3 mb, starting talents shouldnt freeze game anymore
* potion of spell reset now gives 10 spell reset points instead of 1, but its a bit more expensive
* added a lot more dungeon rooms by @Eclipse
